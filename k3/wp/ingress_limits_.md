Here's how you can set it up and some suggestions for developing an ingress-based firewall with NGINX in your k3s cluster.

Steps for Implementing Rate Limiting in NGINX Ingress
Install NGINX Ingress Controller If you haven't already, you need to install the NGINX Ingress Controller in your k3s cluster:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
This command deploys the NGINX Ingress Controller with a default configuration.

Create Ingress for Your WordPress Pods Make sure your WordPress pods are accessible through an ingress resource. Here's an example of a basic ingress for your WordPress service:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: wordpress-ingress
  namespace: wordpress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: wordpress.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: wordpress-service
            port:
              number: 80

```
Enable Rate Limiting Annotations To enable rate limiting, you can use specific annotations supported by the NGINX Ingress Controller. These annotations allow you to set request rate limits per IP, reducing the risk of abuse.

Here’s an example ingress resource with rate limiting enabled:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: wordpress-ingress
  namespace: wordpress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: "10"  # Requests per second limit
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-burst-multiplier: "3"  # Burst capacity (allows bursts 3x the limit)
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rate-after: "5"  # After 5 requests, start rate limiting
spec:
  rules:
  - host: wordpress.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: wordpress-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

Key Annotations for Rate Limiting:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: Limits the number of requests per second from a single IP.
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-burst-multiplier: Allows a burst of requests before rate limiting starts.
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rate-after: Number of requests allowed before applying the rate limit.
Enforce Connection Limits (Optional) To further protect your WordPress pods, you can also limit the number of concurrent connections:

```
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections: "20"  # Max concurrent connections per IP

```
Enable Global Rate Limiting (Optional) You can use NGINX Global Rate Limiting if you want to limit requests across the entire cluster or specific endpoints:

This can be done via Lua scripts and Redis to store the request counts globally.
Monitor and Tune Limits It’s important to monitor the traffic coming to your WordPress pods and adjust the limits as needed. Use tools like kubectl logs to inspect the logs of the NGINX Ingress Controller, and consider setting up metrics collection for better visibility.

Other Considerations
Fail2Ban: Consider integrating a solution like Fail2Ban for blocking IPs that repeatedly exceed the rate limit.

ModSecurity (WAF): Add a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for even more protection. You can integrate ModSecurity with NGINX for application-layer protection against SQL injections, XSS, etc.

API Gateway: If your WordPress has APIs, consider using an API gateway to enforce further rate limits or OAuth protections for those endpoints.

Example Configuration for Helm Chart (NGINX Ingress with Rate Limiting)
If you're using Helm to deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller, you can configure rate limiting in the Helm values file as follows:

```
controller:
  config:
    limit-rate: "10"
    limit-rate-after: "5"
    limit-burst: "30"

```

Then deploy the ingress controller with the new values:
```
helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --values values.yaml
```
