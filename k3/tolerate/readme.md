# Node Pools, Taints, and Tolerations in EKS and k3s with Karpenter

This document summarizes the concepts, differences, and practical YAML examples to help you configure node pools, taints, and tolerations in your Kubernetes deployments. Special attention is given to how these work in Amazon EKS versus k3s clustersâ€”and how Karpenter plays into the picture when dynamically provisioning nodes.

|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Node Pools**    | - **Definition:** Managed groups of nodes with similar configuration (instance type, AMI, labels).<br>- **Management:** Provisioned via Managed Node Groups or self-managed groups.<br>- **Resilience:** Often spans multiple Availability Zones for high availability.<br>- **Use Cases:** Different pools for CPU-intensive, GPU, or memory-optimized workloads. | - **Definition:** While k3s is a lightweight distribution, you can logically group nodes using labels or external tools.<br>- **Management:** Typically managed manually, or through tools such as Rancher or custom automation.<br>- **Environment:** Often found in edge or resource-constrained settings. | - **Dynamic Provisioning:** Karpenter dynamically creates nodes to meet pod scheduling demands.<br>- **Integration:** Instead of relying on pre-existing node pools, Karpenter can supplement or replace them by provisioning nodes with specific labels, taints, and resources based on unscheduled pods.<br>- **Flexibility:** Adapts node configuration based on workload requirements. |
| **Taints**        | - **Purpose:** Prevents pods from scheduling on nodes unless they explicitly tolerate the taint.<br>- **Application:** Applied using `kubectl taint` command or via IaC templates.<br>- **Examples:** Isolating nodes for GPU workloads, security-critical tasks, or dedicated high-performance nodes.                                                   | - **Purpose:** Works the same as standard Kubernetes taints.<br>- **Application:** Set manually or via automation to safeguard specific nodes.<br>- **Examples:** Preventing workload interference, dedicating nodes for special use cases, or isolating experimental features.                                   | - **Provisioning Respect:** Karpenter examines pod tolerations and automatically provisions nodes with the appropriate taints.<br>- **Scheduling:** Ensures that pods with strict toleration requirements only land on nodes that have been configured (or tainted) accordingly by Karpenter.                                                                                             |
| **Tolerations**   | - **Purpose:** Declared in pod specifications to allow them to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.<br>- **Usage:** Specified in the pod spec (YAML) and used to override default taint restrictions.<br>- **Examples:** Pods that need to run on GPU nodes or isolated nodes must include a matching toleration in their spec.                                | - **Purpose:** Function identically as in standard Kubernetes; they enable pods to tolerate node taints.<br>- **Usage:** Specified in the pod manifest to allow scheduling on tainted nodes.<br>- **Examples:** Allowing critical system pods or special workloads to run on nodes even if they are tainted.           | - **Scheduling Decisions:** Karpenter considers pod tolerations during its provisioning logic to decide which node configurations to launch.<br>- **Customization:** Pods that require specific tolerations cause Karpenter to provision nodes that not only meet resource demands but also have the appropriate taints to support these tolerations.                                            |
| **Additional Explanations** | - **Node Pool Management:** In EKS, node pools are a key mechanism for managing groups of nodes safely and efficiently. Managed node groups automate tasks like updates and scaling.<br>- **Taints/Tolerations:** They are core scheduling features used to enforce node-level isolation for sensitive or resource-specific workloads.                                    | - **Lightweight Design:** k3s is designed to be minimal and is often deployed in edge or IoT environments. Grouping and management of nodes might require additional tooling or custom scripts.<br>- **Simplicity:** While k3s supports full Kubernetes features, its node management is often less automated than in EKS.         | - **Karpenter's Role:** Karpenter is designed to optimize autoscaling by provisioning nodes exactly when needed, considering both resource requests and scheduling constraints (taints/tolerations). This ensures efficient utilization of resources regardless of whether nodes come from traditional node pools or are dynamically provisioned.<br>- **Flexibility:** Works with both managed environments like EKS and lightweight clusters like k3s. |

## YAML Examples

### 1. **Deployment YAML with Tolerations (EKS Example)**

This deployment manifest shows how to configure tolerations so that pods are scheduled on nodes with specific taints (e.g., dedicated GPU nodes or high-performance nodes).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: go-hello-world
  labels:
    app: go-hello-world
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: go-hello-world
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: go-hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: go-hello-world
        image: callicoder/go-hello-world:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      tolerations:
      - key: "dedicated"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "gpu"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      - key: "special-workload"
        operator: "Exists"
        effect: "NoExecute"
