Screenshot on CSV Injection Attack
CSV injection is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to inject malicious data into a CSV file. This can happen if the application that processes the CSV file does not properly validate the input, allowing the attacker to insert arbitrary content into the file. The attacker may then be able to manipulate the data in the file, potentially leading to security breaches or other problems. To prevent CSV injection attacks, it is important to always validate user input and ensure that it is free from any malicious content before processing it. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as input sanitization and filtering.
