Description
This is umbrella for address the issues related to user enumeration.

User enumeration allows to figure if particular users exists in Keycloak for instance by monitoring that some requests are longer for existing users rather than for non-existing users.

In general, the priority of username enumeration is questionable as nowadays lots of deployments use "Username first" approach (like Keycloak UsernameForm authenticator), which allows by design to see if particular user exists or not (and note that similar is for instance used by Google by default as well). However for some deployments, this could be a concern.

We are also running into this issue in the 'Forgot password' flow. Filling out a valid username shows an emailSentMessage, filling out an invalid username shows an invalidUserMessage.

Just adding another easy to use method to guess E-Mails and usernames:

If user exists, error message appears next to "Password" input field.
If user doesn't exist, error message appears next to "E-Mail or username" input field.
See screenshots:

error-msg-on-email

error-msg-on-password

Keycloak 23 doesn't suffer from this vulnerability. Keycloak Version 26.0.1 has the vulnerability though we guess it is keycloak-v2 theme related.

Steps to reproduce:

Launch empty keycloak 26.0.1
Login with admin:wrong_password f.e.
Login with admin1:whatever_password f.e.
Compare HTML output machinewise or visually.
Other steps to reproduce via E-Mail:

Launch empty keycloak 26.0.1
Login with admin account and give admin an E-Mail address f.e. admin@exist.ing.
Login with admin@exist.ing:wrong_password f.e.
Login with admin@miss.ing:whatever_password f.e.
Compare HTML output machinewise or visually.
Expected behaviour: HTML output should not show any difference aside some seesion code changed etc. to not reveal existing usernames or E-Mails.

We checked back with them and according to keycloak-security@googlegroups.com this should be handled publicly.

When using UsernameForm it is also possible to enumerate the usernames / emails. Maybe an option like that one in #17629 (comment) can be implemented to reduce attack surface?

Important security vulnerability discovered
December 23 2021 by Stian Thorgersen

This post is more than one year old. The contents within the blog is likely to be out of date.
A flaw (CVE-2021-4133) was found in Keycloak version from 12.0.0 and before 15.1.1 which allows an attacker with any existing user account to create new default user accounts via the administrative REST API even when new user registration is disabled.

In most situations the newly created user is the equivalent of a self-registered user, and does not have the ability to receive any additional roles or groups. However, there are some vectors that are harder to reproduce, but may result in additional privileges.

We highly recommend everyone upgrade to Keycloak 15.1.1 or 16.1.0 as soon as possible. Keycloak 16.0.0 also includes the fix, but if you are not already running this version we recommend going straight to 16.1.0.

If you are unable to upgrade we recommend mitigate the issue by blocking access to the user creation REST endpoint in the interim.

This can be achieved with the following CLI commands:

bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect
/subsystem=undertow/configuration=filter/expression-filter=keycloakPathOverrideUsersCreateEndpoint:add( \
  expression="(regex('^/auth/admin/realms/(.*)/users$') and method(POST))-> response-code(400)" \
)
/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/host=default-host/filter-ref=keycloakPathOverrideUsersCreateEndpoint:add()
This will block both valid and invalid attempts at creating new users, including requests from the Keycloak admin console.

Alternatively, the path /auth/admin/realms/.*/users and method POST, or /auth/admin completely, can be blocked with a firewall.

For more information about the flaw please view CVE-2021-4133 and GHSA-83x4-9cwr-5487.
