OAuth 2.0 uses application/x-www-form-urlencoded for its POST 
requests primarily due to historical and practical reasons rooted in web standards and interoperability. 

Here’s a detailed explanation:

Historical Context
Early Web Standards:

Early web forms predominantly used application/x-www-form-urlencoded to encode form data. This encoding format is simple and supported by virtually all web browsers and servers.
When OAuth 2.0 was being developed, it aligned with these established web standards to ensure broad compatibility and ease of implementation.
Interoperability:

application/x-www-form-urlencoded is universally supported across HTTP clients and servers. This widespread support ensures that OAuth 2.0 implementations can work across diverse systems without requiring special handling or custom parsers.
By using this encoding, OAuth 2.0 can leverage existing libraries and frameworks that handle form submissions, simplifying the development process.
Practical Reasons
Simplicity and Readability:

Form-urlencoded data is easy to construct and parse. It represents a key-value pair structure that maps naturally to HTML forms and URL query parameters, making it straightforward for developers to work with.
Example of form-urlencoded data: grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&redirect_uri=https://client.example.com/cb
Compatibility with Form Submissions:

OAuth 2.0 often involves user interaction through web forms (e.g., entering credentials, authorizing applications). Using application/x-www-form-urlencoded allows these forms to be directly submitted to OAuth endpoints without additional processing or encoding.
This encoding ensures that form data sent by browsers is correctly interpreted by OAuth 2.0 servers.
Security Considerations:

While other content types like application/json are also popular, using application/x-www-form-urlencoded minimizes the attack surface by adhering to well-understood, time-tested standards.
OAuth 2.0 typically uses HTTPS for transport encryption, which secures the data in transit. The simplicity of form-urlencoded data helps prevent common implementation errors that might arise from more complex encodings.
Examples in OAuth 2.0
Authorization Code Grant:

The client exchanges an authorization code for an access token using a POST request with form-urlencoded data:
http
Copy code
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&redirect_uri=https://client.example.com/cb
Password Grant:

The client sends the user’s credentials to obtain an access token:
http
Copy code
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=password&username=johndoe&password=A3ddj3w
Conclusion
The use of application/x-www-form-urlencoded in OAuth 2.0 POST requests is a result of historical web practices and the need for broad compatibility, simplicity, and security. By adhering to this well-supported encoding standard, OAuth 2.0 ensures that its implementations can easily interact with a wide range of HTTP clients and servers, leveraging existing web technologies and minimizing the risk of errors.

Just for the record, the OAuth2 spec specifies that the token endpoint MUST receive the request in the body using form encoding, that is, with content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Using JSON in this scenario is just plain wrong and would break compatibility with other OAuth2 clients.

The following is an example from RFC6749:

POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb
You should only do this if you are 100% aware that you are breaking compatibility with standard OAuth2 clients, and you are fine with that.

Expected Behavior
Help Wanted
I am trying to get the oauth2 token and my code snippet is as below

var client = new RestClient("https://url/oauth2/token");
        var request = new RestRequest(Method.POST);
        request.AddHeader("cache-control", "no-cache");
        request.AddHeader("content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
        request.AddHeader("Authorization", "Basic clientusername:clientpassword");
        request.AddParameter("application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "grant_type=password&username=user&password=pwd", ParameterType.RequestBody);
        IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
then I also tried something like below

var client = new RestClient($"{_apiBaseUrl}/token")
            {
                Authenticator = new HttpBasicAuthenticator(_clientId, _clientSecret)
            };
            var request = new RestRequest(Method.POST);
            request.AddHeader("cache-control", "no-cache");
            request.AddHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
            request.AddParameter("application/x-www-form-urlencoded", $"grant_type=password&username={username}&password={password}&scope=CORE PFM FRAME", ParameterType.RequestBody);
var response = client.Execute(request);
then

var client = new RestClient(_apiBaseUrl");
            var req = new RestRequest("/token", Method.POST);
            req.AddParameter("client_id", _clientId, ParameterType.GetOrPost);
            req.AddParameter("grant_type", "password", ParameterType.GetOrPost);
            req.AddParameter("client_secret", _clientSecret, ParameterType.GetOrPost);
            req.AddParameter("application/x-www-form-urlencoded", $"grant_type=password&username={username}&password={password}&scope=CORE PFM FRAME", ParameterType.RequestBody);
Actual Behavior
but always get below error
{"fault":{"faultstring":"UrlDecoding of the form parameters from the request message failed. The form parameters needs to be url encoded","detail":{"errorcode":"steps.oauth.v2.InvalidRequest"}}}

There were quite a few changes done with OAuth, but I am not the one who was doing these changes since I don't use OAuth2. It would be nice if you can test the latest version.

There are a couple of things to mention.

First, it would help to know where are you trying to get the OAuth2 token from, maybe even a link to the documentation if the service is public.

Second, you manually add the body parameter with application/x-www-form-urlencoded and the parameter value is not URL encoded, although you tell the server that it is, and your parameter value contains unencoded string. Why are you doing this? If you use AddParameter("grant_type", "whatever") we will add it to the request body if you do the POST request and will assign the application/x-www-form-urlencoded for you.

Third, you use three completely different methods to get the token like there are three different APIs. What are you trying to do? I checked the Twitter API and the HubSpot API to get the OAuth2 token and they both are different.

Plus, we have the OAth2Authenticator base class that has two simple implementations, from which you can rather easily figure out how to make your own, API specific authenticator.
