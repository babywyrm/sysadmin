OAuth Entities
The OAuth protocol comprises the following acting entities:

The Resource Owner: The entity that owns the resource. This is typically the user.
The Client: The service requesting access to the resource on behalf of the resource owner.
The Authorization Server: The server that authenticates the resource owner and issues access tokens to the client.
The Resource Server: The server hosting the resources the client requests to access.
Note that these entities are not required to be physically separate. For instance, the authorization and resource servers may be the same system.

Abstract Communication Flow
The communication flow between these entities works as follows:

The client requests authorization from the resource owner.
The client receives an authorization grant from the resource owner.
The client presents the authorization grant to the authorization server.
The client receives an access token from the authorization server.
The client presents the access token to the resource server.
The client receives the resource from the resource server.
Concrete Example
Let's consider the following entities:

Resource owner: The user, who we will name Alice.
Client: An imaginary fitness tracking platform called fittrack.com.
Authorization Server: An imaginary platform for identity management called authserve.com.
Resource Server: For simplicity's sake, this is the same as the authorization server: authserve.com.
Assume that Alice wants to log in to fittrack.com using her authserve.com account. The communication flow may look like this:

Alice clicks "Login with authserve.com" on fittrack.com. She is redirected to the login page of authserve.com.
Alice logs in to authserve.com and consents to giving access to her profile to the third-party service fittrack.com. Afterward, authserve.com issues an authorization grant to fittrack.com.
fittrack.com presents the authorization grant to authserve.com.
authserve.com validates the authorization grant and issues an access token that enables fittrack.com to access Alice's profile.
fittrack.com presents the access token to authserve.com in a request to an API endpoint that accesses Alice's profile information.
authserve.com validates the access token and provides fittrack.com with Alice's profile information.
After the exchange, fittrack.com can access Alice's profile information on authserve.com, i.e., make requests to authserve.com in Alice's name. This is achieved without sharing Alice's credentials with fittrack.com.

OAuth Grant Types
OAuth defines different grants used for different contexts and use cases. We will look at the two most common grant types, the authorization code grant and the implicit grant.

Authorization Code Grant
The authorization code grant is the most common and secure OAuth grant type. This grant type's flow is the same as the abstract flow discussed above.

Step-by-Step Flow:

Authorization Request:

http
Copy code
GET /auth?client_id=1234&redirect_uri=http://fittrack.com/callback&response_type=code&scope=user&state=randomstate HTTP/1.1 
Host: authserve.com
client_id: A unique identifier for the client fittrack.com.
redirect_uri: The URL to which the browser will be redirected after a successful authorization by the resource owner.
response_type: This is always set to code for the authorization code grant.
scope: Indicates what resources the client fittrack.com needs to access.
state: A random nonce generated by the client that serves a similar purpose to a CSRF token tying the authorization request to the following callback request.
Resource Owner Authentication:

The authorization server authserve.com will request the user to log in and authorize the client fittrack.com to access the requested resources.
Authorization Code Grant:

http
Copy code
GET /callback?code=abc123&state=randomstate HTTP/1.1
Host: fittrack.com
code: The authorization code issued by the authorization server.
state: The state value from the authorization request to tie these two requests together.
Access Token Request:

http
Copy code
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authserve.com

client_id=1234&client_secret=SECRET&redirect_uri=http://fittrack.com/callback&grant_type=authorization_code&code=abc123
client_secret: A secret value assigned to the client by the authorization server during the initial registration.
grant_type: This is always set to authorization_code for the authorization code grant.
Access Token Grant:

json
Copy code
{
  "access_token": "token123",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
Resource Request:

http
Copy code
GET /user_info HTTP/1.1
Host: authserve.com
Authorization: Bearer token123
Resource Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "username": "alice",
  "email": "alice@authserve.com",
  "id": 1234
}
Implicit Grant
The implicit code grant is shorter than the authorization code grant as the authorization code exchange is skipped. This results in a more straightforward implementation at the cost of lower security since access tokens are exposed in the browser.

Step-by-Step Flow:

Authorization Request:

http
Copy code
GET /auth?client_id=1234&redirect_uri=http://fittrack.com/callback&response_type=token&scope=user&state=randomstate HTTP/1.1 
Host: authserve.com
The response_type parameter is set to token.
Resource Owner Authentication:

The authorization server authserve.com will request the user to log in and authorize the client fittrack.com to access the requested resources.
Access Token Grant:

http
Copy code
GET /callback#access_token=token123&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=3600&scope=user&state=randomstate HTTP/1.1
Host: fittrack.com
Resource Request:

http
Copy code
GET /user_info HTTP/1.1
Host: authserve.com
Authorization: Bearer token123
Resource Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "username": "alice",
  "email": "alice@authserve.com",
  "id": 1234
}
In both examples, the client fittrack.com can access Alice's profile information on authserve.com without requiring Alice to share her credentials with fittrack.com.
