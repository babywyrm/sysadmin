Write the Java service:
Let's create a simple Java service that returns a "Hello, World!" message. Create a new Java file called HelloWorld.java with the following content:

```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Compile the Java service:
Next, we need to compile the Java code using Amazon Corretto 17. To do this, we can use the javac command. In the command line, navigate to the directory where the HelloWorld.java file is located and run the following command:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp amazoncorretto:17-alpine javac HelloWorld.java
```

This command runs a Docker container with the Amazon Corretto 17 Alpine image and mounts the current directory to /usr/src/myapp inside the container. We then change the working directory to /usr/src/myapp and run the javac command to compile the HelloWorld.java file.

Create a Dockerfile:
Now that we have our compiled Java code, we can create a Docker image for our service. Create a new file called Dockerfile with the following content:

```
FROM amazoncorretto:17-alpine
COPY HelloWorld.class /
CMD ["java", "HelloWorld"]
```

This Dockerfile starts with the Amazon Corretto 17 Alpine image, copies the compiled HelloWorld.class file to the root directory of the container, and sets the command to run the java command with the HelloWorld class.

Build the Docker image:
To build the Docker image, run the following command in the same directory where the Dockerfile is located:

docker build -t my-hello-world .

This command builds a Docker image with the tag my-hello-world using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

# Push the Docker image:
