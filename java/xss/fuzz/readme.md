# XSS Engine ( Beta )

A flexible, config-driven toolkit for discovering reflected, stored and DOM-based XSS in JSON APIs, HTML endpoints and JavaScript apps.  
Ideal for CTF challenges, pentests or smoke-testing your own services (e.g. WordPress/cms â†’ Flask/Golang/Etc RCE chains).

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **JSON fuzzing**  
  Inject XSS payloads into arbitrary JSON fields (e.g. `/api/messages`) and look for reflections.
- **Reflected HTML scans**  
  Hit reflected endpoints (e.g. `/search?q={payload}`) and detect injected alerts/dialogs.
- **DOM-based checks**  
  Drive a headless browser (Playwright) to catch XSS that only appears at render-time.
- **CORS testing**  
  Optionally send an `Origin` header to verify your service permits cross-site requests.
- **Modular payload library**  
  Built-in defaults plus the ability to define your own payload lists in YAML.
- **Pluggable reporters**  
  Console output or JSON file for easy CI integration and dashboards.
