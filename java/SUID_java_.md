How to execute shell command in Javascript

I want to write a JavaScript function which will execute the system shell commands (ls for example) and return the value.

How do I achieve this?

where would you like to execute this command, on the client or on the server? –

I'll answer assuming that when the asker said "Shell Script" he meant a Node.js backend JavaScript. Possibly using commander.js to use frame your code :)

You could use the child_process module from node's API. I pasted the example code below.

```
var exec = require('child_process').exec;

exec('cat *.js bad_file | wc -l',
    function (error, stdout, stderr) {
        console.log('stdout: ' + stdout);
        console.log('stderr: ' + stderr);
        if (error !== null) {
             console.log('exec error: ' + error);
        }
    });

```

Except for one thing. You'll get the error "child is not a function". The call to exec() executes the command - no need to call child(). Unfortunately, the callback isn't called whenever the child process has something to output - it is called only when the child process exits. Sometimes that's OK and sometimes it's not. –

I don't know why the previous answers gave all sorts of complicated solutions. If you just want to execute a quick command like ls, you don't need async/await or callbacks or anything. Here's all you need - execSync:

const execSync = require('child_process').execSync;
// import { execSync } from 'child_process';  // replace ^ if using ES modules

const output = execSync('ls', { encoding: 'utf-8' });  // the default is 'buffer'
console.log('Output was:\n', output);
For error handling, add a try/catch block around the statement.

If you're running a command that takes a long time to complete, then yes, look at the asynchronous exec function.

Does execSync works with Mac, Linux and Windows commands? –

Confirmed for windows. Also, I see that there's a shell option for specifying "Shell to execute the command with." Default: '/bin/sh' on Unix, process.env.ComSpec on Windows. –

Please do not use synchronous external operations, because your server will not be able to serve other requests until it is finished. –

...few year later...

ES6 has been accepted as a standard and ES7 is around the corner so it deserves updated answer. We'll use ES6+async/await with nodejs+babel as an example, prerequisites are:

nodejs with npm
babel
Your example foo.js file may look like:
```
import { exec } from 'child_process';

/**
 * Execute simple shell command (async wrapper).
 * @param {String} cmd
 * @return {Object} { stdout: String, stderr: String }
 */
async function sh(cmd) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    exec(cmd, (err, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(err);
      } else {
        resolve({ stdout, stderr });
      }
    });
  });
}

async function main() {
  let { stdout } = await sh('ls');
  for (let line of stdout.split('\n')) {
    console.log(`ls: ${line}`);
  }
}
```
main();
Make sure you have babel:

npm i babel-cli -g
Install latest preset:

npm i babel-preset-latest
Run it via:

babel-node --presets latest foo.js

If you only need to execute a quick command, all the async/await is overkill. You can just use execSync. –

@Virus721: in which JavaScript runtime do you want to execute a shell command? –

This depends entirely on the JavaScript environment. Please elaborate.

For example, in Windows Scripting, you do things like:

var shell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell");
shell.Run("command here");

In a nutshell:
```
// Instantiate the Shell object and invoke its execute method.
var oShell = new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application");

var commandtoRun = "C:\\Winnt\\Notepad.exe";
if (inputparms != "") {
  var commandParms = document.Form1.filename.value;
}

// Invoke the execute method.  
oShell.ShellExecute(commandtoRun, commandParms, "", "open", "1");

```







With NodeJS is simple like that! And if you want to run this script at each boot of your server, you can have a look on the forever-service application!

var exec = require('child_process').exec;

exec('php main.php', function (error, stdOut, stdErr) {
    // do what you want!
});

```


function exec(cmd, handler = function(error, stdout, stderr){console.log(stdout);if(error !== null){console.log(stderr)}})
{
    const childfork = require('child_process');
    return childfork.exec(cmd, handler);
}
This function can be easily used like:

exec('echo test');
//output:
//test

exec('echo test', function(err, stdout){console.log(stdout+stdout+stdout)});
//output:
//testtesttest
```

If you are using npm you can use the shelljs package

To install: npm install [-g] shelljs

var shell = require('shelljs');
shell.ls('*.js').forEach(function (file) {
// do something
});
See more: https://www.npmjs.com/package/shelljs

With nashorn you can write a script like this:

$EXEC('find -type f');
var files = $OUT.split('\n');
files.forEach(...
...
