Step 1: Create the JSON Configuration File
To handle authentication, you’ll need to define your login and session handling configurations in a JSON file. This file should include:

Target URLs: The application or API endpoints to scan.
Authentication Details: Define session rules, macros for login, token extraction, etc.
Scan Profile: Specify crawl and scan configurations.
Here’s an example JSON configuration file (myconfig.json) for a headless Burp session:

```
{
  "target": {
    "scope": {
      "include": [
        {
          "url": "http://example.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "authentication": {
    "enabled": true,
    "login_url": "http://example.com/login",
    "credentials": {
      "username": "myUsername",
      "password": "myPassword"
    },
    "session_rules": [
      {
        "rule_name": "Auth Session Handling",
        "scope": "in-scope only",
        "macro": [
          {
            "request": {
              "method": "POST",
              "url": "http://example.com/login",
              "body": "username=myUsername&password=myPassword"
            },
            "response_extraction": {
              "token_name": "sessionid",
              "match_type": "regex",
              "regex": "sessionid=([a-zA-Z0-9]+);"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "scanner": {
    "active_scan": true,
    "scan_config": "full_scan"
  }
}

```
In this configuration:

Target Scope: Only URLs in scope will be scanned.
Authentication: The session_rules section defines the login flow and session handling rules. Here, a macro is created to log in by sending a POST request, extracting a session token with regex, and applying it to subsequent requests.
Scan Profile: Specifies a custom scan profile (full_scan) for the scanner.
Step 2: Run Burp in Headless Mode with the JSON Configuration
Once the JSON configuration file is ready, you can start Burp in headless mode using the --config-file flag to apply these settings.

```

java -jar burpsuite_pro.jar --project-file=myproject.burp --config-file=myconfig.json

```

Step 3: Automate Scan Initialization and Endpoint Seeding
If you want to automate seeding specific endpoints for scanning, you can use the Burp REST API to initialize scans on each endpoint after Burp has started with the headless configuration.

Here’s a Python script example that reads endpoints from a list, starts scans using the Burp REST API, and then monitors scan results:


```
import requests
import json
import time

# Set up Burp Suite REST API
burp_url = "http://localhost:1337/v0.1/"
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

# List of endpoints to seed
seed_endpoints = [
    "http://example.com/api/endpoint1",
    "http://example.com/api/endpoint2"
]

# Function to start a scan on a specific endpoint
def start_scan(endpoint_url):
    scan_config = {
        "urls": [endpoint_url],
        "scan_config": "full_scan"
    }
    response = requests.post(burp_url + "scan", headers=headers, data=json.dumps(scan_config))
    return response.json()

# Start scans for each endpoint
for endpoint in seed_endpoints:
    scan_response = start_scan(endpoint)
    print(f"Started scan for {endpoint}: {scan_response}")

# Monitor scan status
def monitor_scans():
    while True:
        response = requests.get(burp_url + "scans", headers=headers)
        scans = response.json()
        all_done = all(scan['status'] == "completed" for scan in scans)
        
        if all_done:
            print("All scans completed.")
            break
        else:
            print("Scanning in progress...")
            time.sleep(30)  # Polling interval

monitor_scans()
```

Notes

Authentication Profiles in JSON: Burp Suite supports more complex authentication workflows, such as session tokens or JWTs, 
which you can set up within the session_rules in JSON to mimic complex login flows.
REST API for Customization: The Burp API provides endpoints to monitor scan progress, fetch results, and generate reports.
This setup fully automates the headless, authenticated scanning process, allowing you to launch Burp Suite in a CI/CD pipeline or cron job. 
By using the JSON configuration and Burp API, you maintain flexibility to update configurations or seed endpoints as needed.
