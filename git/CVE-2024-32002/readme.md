##

This repository contains a PoC for exploiting CVE-2024-32002, a vulnerability in Git that allows RCE during a `git clone` operation. By crafting repositories with submodules in a specific way, an attacker can exploit symlink handling on case-insensitive filesystems to write files into the `.git/` directory, leading to the execution of malicious hooks.

**Note:** This PoC will only work in Windows or Mac systems.

## Blog Post
For a detailed explanation of how this exploit was reversed, see the blog post: <https://amalmurali.me/posts/git-rce>.


## How It Works
1. A malicious repository (`git_rce`) includes a submodule with a specially crafted path.
2. The submodule path uses a case variation that exploits the case-insensitive filesystem.
3. The submodule includes a symlink pointing to its `.git/` directory, which contains a malicious hook.
4. When the repository is cloned, the symlink is followed, and the malicious hook is executed, leading to RCE.

## Repository Structure

- `git_rce/` (this repository): The main repository containing the submodule.
- [`amalmurali47/hook`](https://github.com/amalmurali47/hook): The submodule repository containing the malicious hook.

## Reproduction

⚠️ Warning: Do not run this PoC on systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to use. Unauthorized testing could result in unintended consequences.

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:amalmurali47/git_rce.git
```

Note: On Windows, you may need to run the shell as administrator for this to work.
