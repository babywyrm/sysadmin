the first step in the process would be to disable apport.
This can be done by editing the /etc/default/apport file, and setting enabled=0.

systemctl stop apport
systemctl disable apport

Then change kernel core_pattern

echo "kernel.core_pattern=/tmp/%e.%t.%p.%s.core" > /etc/sysctl.d/60-core-pattern.conf
sysctl --system

Another alternative is to use Apport to handle your crashes. It will save the core dump,
along with a ton of other useful context about the crash. Add the following lines
to ~/.config/apport/settings (create it if it doesn't exist):

[main]
unpackaged=true

Now crashes will appear as Apport .crash files in /var/crash. You can unpack them with apport-unpack.

One caveat: it appears that Apport still tries to upload these crashes to the Ubuntu bug tracker
if the user leaves the 'Send error report' checkbox checked; this may be a problem if you are working
on proprietary code, etc. I'm looking for more info on this; it seems that /etc/apport/crashdb.conf
may control where the crash reports get sent.
