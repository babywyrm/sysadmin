Budget & Costs
Initial Investment:
Expect to spend approximately $30-$50 CAD in the first year for basic audit preparation and tooling.
Ongoing Costs:
Additional annual expenses may include third-party audit fees, advanced tooling, and compliance platform subscriptions.
Timeline
Preparation: 1–3 months to document and implement controls.
Observation & Reporting:
SOC 2 Type 1: A snapshot at a specific point in time.
SOC 2 Type 2: An observation period (typically 3–6 months) to demonstrate the operational effectiveness of controls.
Audit Types & Decisions
Type 1 vs. Type 2
Type 1:

Definition: A snapshot audit that assesses the design of security controls at a particular point in time.
Use Case: Ideal for startups beginning their compliance journey; establishes a baseline for future improvements.
Type 2:

Definition: A longitudinal audit that evaluates the effectiveness of security controls over a period of time (typically 3–12 months).
Use Case: Suitable for mature organizations needing to demonstrate ongoing control effectiveness.
Decision Point:
Determine which type fits your business needs. Many startups begin with a Type 1 audit and transition to Type 2 as they scale.

Scope of the Audit
In Scope:
Identify the parts of your organization that handle sensitive data, such as customer information, payment data, and internal systems (e.g., production infrastructure, IT systems).
Out of Scope:
Non-critical functions like marketing or public relations may be excluded to narrow the focus and reduce audit complexity.
Tools & Platforms
Modern SOC 2 programs leverage automated tools to streamline compliance. Here are key categories and modern examples:

Audit Preparation & Continuous Compliance

Security Monitoring & Vulnerability Scanning
Detectify: Automated web application vulnerability scanning. ✅
Sqreen: Real-time security monitoring for applications. ✅
Snyk: Developer-friendly vulnerability scanning for code and dependencies. ✅
Infrastructure & Configuration
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code to maintain auditable, version-controlled infrastructure. ✅
AWS & Google Cloud:
Both offer native SOC 2 compliance reports and integrate with compliance tools. ✅
Staff Security Training
Cybrary: Free and paid security courses recommended by compliance frameworks. ✅
Hutsix: Interactive security awareness training. ✅
Logging & Auditable Infrastructure
Papertrail (Heroku Add-on): For long-term log retention and analysis. ✅
AWS CloudTrail & AWS Config: For continuous monitoring and compliance audits. ✅
Additional Modern Considerations
Automated Code Reviews: GitHub’s Dependabot and integrated code scanning features.
Container Security: Tools like Trivy and AWS ECR Container Scanning ensure your container images are secure.
CI/CD Security: Integrate security checks into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions with security scanners).
Implementation Plan & Migration Notes
Migration Roadmap:

If you’re moving from platforms like Heroku to AWS or another cloud provider, plan to transition without disrupting critical services.
Use Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) to replicate your environment securely and auditably.
Documentation:

Ensure all processes, policies, and security controls are documented and version-controlled (using GitHub or similar tools).
Regularly update your documentation to reflect changes in controls or processes.
Training & Awareness:

Conduct regular security awareness training for staff.
Keep your team updated on compliance requirements and best practices.

AWS-Specific Configuration & Best Practices
Multi-Factor Authentication for Critical Operations:
Enable MFA for actions like S3 bucket deletion or IAM changes.

See: Enabled MFA for S3 Bucket Deletion
Log Retention & Monitoring:
Implement long-term log retention with tools like Papertrail (for Heroku) or AWS CloudTrail, ensuring logs are stored for at least 365 days.

Encryption at Rest & in Transit:
Use standard encryption practices for databases and file storage (e.g., AWS RDS encryption, ECR container scanning).

Final Notes
Tailor the Scope:
Clearly define which parts of your organization are within scope for SOC 2 (e.g., exclude non-critical departments like marketing if necessary).

Audit Approach:
Start with a Type 1 audit to establish baseline controls and then progress to Type 2 as you mature your security program.

Continuous Compliance:
Leverage automated tools like Vanta or Drata to continuously monitor compliance and reduce audit friction.

Version Control & Transparency:
Maintain all compliance documentation, policies, and evidence in a version-controlled repository (like GitHub) for transparency and auditability.
