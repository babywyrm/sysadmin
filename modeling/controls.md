# Secure Model for Product Security



## Overview

The approach is structured to logically flow from establishing a zero trust foundation,
through detailed technical controls, to proactive threat management. 
Each control area is designed to support both modern microservices environments and traditional on-prem Linux agents.

Consider frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, or SOC 2 to guide compliance measures.                                                                                                                              |
| **Code Security & Secure Development** | Integrate security into the development lifecycle to catch vulnerabilities early.                                                                               | Implement static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST), perform regular code reviews, and integrate secure coding training into developer education. Use continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with automated security checks.          |
| **Supply Chain Security & SBOM**       | Ensure the integrity of third-party components and monitor for vulnerabilities in dependencies.                                                                  | Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all products, use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerabilities, and enforce vendor risk management processes.                                                                                                |
| **Threat Modeling & Risk Management**  | Proactively identify, assess, and mitigate potential threats to products and infrastructure.                                                                    | Conduct regular threat modeling sessions (e.g., STRIDE, PASTA) and red teaming exercises. Develop incident response plans and continuously update risk assessments to address emerging threats.                                                                                       |
