# Threat Model Policy: Evaluating Attacker Capabilities, Detection & Remediation

## Overview

This document provides a systematic approach to threat modeling by evaluating the capabilities an attacker might possess at each stage of an attack, along with detection tools and remediation processes. By understanding worst-case scenarios, organizations can develop effective mitigation strategies—particularly for public-facing SaaS applications and containerized microservices running on EKS. This model is built on a Zero Trust foundation with strong authentication and authorization controls.

## Attack Lifecycle Stages, Detection Tools & Remediation

### 1. Reconnaissance

**Objective:**  
Gather comprehensive information about the target environment.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- **Public Footprint Analysis:** Identify exposed endpoints, subdomains, APIs, and cloud configurations using OSINT techniques.
- **Automated Scanning:** Perform network and vulnerability scans to enumerate available services.
- **Social Engineering:** Exploit public information and personnel data to uncover internal processes.

**Detection Tools (Blue Team - Open Source):**
- **Recon-ng:** A full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework.
- **theHarvester:** For gathering emails, subdomains, and hostnames from public sources.
- **Shodan & Censys:** (Free tiers or open source alternatives) for external asset discovery.
- **OSQuery:** To monitor system configuration changes that may indicate reconnaissance activities.

**Remediation & Process:**
- **Remediation:** Limit public exposure by using reverse proxies, API gateways, and proper network segmentation.
- **Process:** Implement periodic external penetration tests and continuous monitoring. Use threat intelligence feeds to update asset inventories and block suspicious IPs.

**Zero Trust Considerations:**  
- Assume every external source is untrusted. Enforce strict authentication and micro-segmentation even for public-facing resources.

### 2. Initial Access

**Objective:**  
Gain unauthorized entry into the environment through exploitation or misconfiguration.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** Leverage flaws such as SQL injection, XSS, or API misconfigurations.
- **Misconfiguration Exploitation:** Exploit weak or overly permissive IAM policies, public S3 buckets, or unprotected endpoints.
- **Credential Harvesting:** Bypass MFA or use stolen credentials.

**Detection Tools (Blue Team - Open Source):**
- **OWASP ZAP:** For automated scanning of web application vulnerabilities.
- **Nikto:** A web server scanner to detect outdated software and misconfigurations.
- **Falco:** An open source runtime security tool that can detect abnormal application behavior.
- **Suricata:** For network traffic analysis and intrusion detection.

**Remediation & Process:**
- **Remediation:** Patch vulnerabilities promptly, enforce MFA, and implement least privilege access policies.
- **Process:** Integrate automated vulnerability scans into CI/CD pipelines. Establish an incident response plan that includes verification of authentication and authorization configurations.

**Zero Trust Considerations:**  
- Implement continuous validation of user identity and access context. Ensure robust multi-factor authentication and granular RBAC/ABAC policies.

### 3. Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation

**Objective:**  
Expand access within the environment and escalate privileges.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- **Lateral Movement:** Exploit trust relationships between microservices and compromised accounts.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Leverage vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain administrative privileges.
- **Internal Reconnaissance:** Enumerate internal networks, services, and sensitive data repositories.

**Detection Tools (Blue Team - Open Source):**
- **OSQuery & Auditd:** Monitor system calls and user activities for anomalous behavior.
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA):** Enforce and audit policies across microservices.
- **Falco:** To detect unexpected process executions or container escapes.
- **Kube-bench / Kube-hunter:** For Kubernetes-specific security checks.

**Remediation & Process:**
- **Remediation:** Enforce micro-segmentation and network isolation, restrict lateral movement via strict service-to-service authentication, and regularly review privilege assignments.
- **Process:** Conduct regular internal audits and red team exercises. Use automated tools to monitor inter-service communications and detect privilege escalation attempts.

**Zero Trust Considerations:**  
- Do not assume internal traffic is safe. Authenticate and authorize each inter-service communication, enforcing minimal trust.

### 4. Persistence & Data Exfiltration

**Objective:**  
Maintain long-term access and extract sensitive data.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- **Establishing Persistence:** Create hidden accounts, install backdoors, or exploit container vulnerabilities.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Steal critical data such as customer PII, proprietary information, or configuration secrets.
- **Covering Tracks:** Modify logs or use encrypted channels to evade detection.

**Detection Tools (Blue Team - Open Source):**
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** For log aggregation and anomaly detection.
- **Wazuh:** An open source security monitoring tool that integrates with OSQuery and ELK.
- **Falco:** To detect abnormal behavior indicating persistence or data exfiltration.
- **Sysmon for Linux:** For detailed monitoring of system activity.

**Remediation & Process:**
- **Remediation:** Harden systems to prevent unauthorized access, remove persistent backdoors, and use data loss prevention (DLP) tools.
- **Process:** Implement continuous logging, regular audits, and an incident response plan that prioritizes rapid detection and remediation of persistence mechanisms.

**Zero Trust Considerations:**  
- Enforce continuous monitoring and session validation. Encrypt data at rest and in transit and regularly review log integrity.

## Methodology for Evaluating Worst-Case Scenarios

1. **Asset Identification:**  
   Catalogue all systems, applications, and data flows within the SaaS and EKS environments.

2. **Threat Enumeration:**  
   Identify potential threat vectors using frameworks such as STRIDE or PASTA.

3. **Impact Analysis:**  
   Assess the business and operational impact if an attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability.

4. **Likelihood Assessment:**  
   Determine the probability of exploitation based on current controls and known vulnerabilities.

5. **Mitigation Planning:**  
   Prioritize remediation efforts based on impact and likelihood, and establish specific controls to mitigate risks.

## Recommendations & Best Practices

- **Adopt Zero Trust Principles:**  
  Enforce robust authentication and granular authorization controls across all network and application layers.

- **Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response:**  
  Deploy SIEM systems, endpoint detection tools, and automated alerts to detect and respond to threats in real time.

- **Regular Red Teaming & Penetration Testing:**  
  Test your defenses with simulated attacks to validate your threat model and improve resilience.

- **Integrate Threat Modeling into DevSecOps:**  
  Make threat modeling a continuous process within your CI/CD pipeline to stay ahead of emerging threats.

- **Automate Vulnerability Assessments:**  
  Utilize open source tools to continuously monitor and remediate vulnerabilities as they are discovered.

## Conclusion

By evaluating an attacker's capabilities at each stage—from reconnaissance to persistence—and pairing these insights with robust detection tools and well-defined remediation processes, organizations can better prepare for worst-case scenarios. This threat model policy emphasizes a Zero Trust approach with continuous authentication and authorization, ensuring that even if one layer is breached, the overall security posture remains strong. The methodologies and recommendations outlined here are designed to guide proactive threat mitigation for public-facing SaaS applications and EKS microservices.
