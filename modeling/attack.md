# Threat Model Policy: Evaluating Attacker Capabilities & Worst-Case Scenarios

## Overview

This document provides a systematic approach to threat modeling by evaluating the capabilities an attacker might possess at each stage of an attack. By understanding the worst-case scenarios, organizations can develop effective mitigation strategies—particularly for public-facing SaaS applications and EKS microservices. This model assumes a Zero Trust framework where no access is inherently trusted, and robust authentication and authorization (AuthN/AuthZ) controls are enforced at every layer.

## Attack Lifecycle Stages & Attacker Capabilities

### 1. Reconnaissance

**Objective:**  
Gather comprehensive information about the target environment.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- **Public Footprint Analysis:**  
  Identify exposed endpoints, subdomains, APIs, and cloud configurations using OSINT techniques.
- **Automated Scanning:**  
  Perform network and vulnerability scans to enumerate available services.
- **Social Engineering:**  
  Exploit public information and personnel data to uncover internal processes.

**Zero Trust Considerations:**  
- No endpoint is assumed trusted; all external information is treated with skepticism.
- Implement strict access controls to minimize publicly exposed interfaces.

### 2. Initial Access

**Objective:**  
Gain unauthorized entry into the environment through exploitation or misconfiguration.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:**  
  Leverage flaws such as SQL injection, XSS, or API misconfigurations.
- **Misconfiguration Exploitation:**  
  Exploit weak or overly permissive IAM policies, public S3 buckets, or unprotected endpoints.
- **Credential Harvesting:**  
  Bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) or use stolen credentials to gain access.

**Zero Trust Considerations:**  
- Continuous validation of user identity via robust AuthN.
- Granular AuthZ to restrict access based on verified roles and context.

### 3. Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation

**Objective:**  
Expand access within the environment and escalate privileges.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- **Lateral Movement:**  
  Exploit trust relationships between microservices and compromised accounts to move laterally.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  
  Leverage vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher-level privileges.
- **Internal Reconnaissance:**  
  Enumerate internal networks, services, and sensitive data repositories.

**Zero Trust Considerations:**  
- Every inter-service request requires explicit authorization and is continuously validated.
- Zero inherent trust between different segments; segmentation and micro-segmentation are enforced.

### 4. Persistence & Data Exfiltration

**Objective:**  
Maintain long-term access and extract sensitive data.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- **Establishing Persistence:**  
  Create hidden accounts, install backdoors, or exploit container vulnerabilities.
- **Data Exfiltration:**  
  Extract critical data such as customer PII, intellectual property, and configuration secrets.
- **Covering Tracks:**  
  Manipulate or delete logs and use encrypted channels to avoid detection.

**Zero Trust Considerations:**  
- Continuously monitor and validate all sessions, even those deemed "internal."
- Employ strong data encryption and integrity checks to detect unauthorized changes or exfiltration.

## Methodology for Evaluating Worst-Case Scenarios

1. **Asset Identification:**  
   Catalogue all assets, services, and data flows within the SaaS and EKS environments.

2. **Threat Enumeration:**  
   Identify potential threat vectors using frameworks like STRIDE or PASTA.

3. **Impact Analysis:**  
   Assess the potential impact if an attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability.

4. **Likelihood Assessment:**  
   Determine the probability of exploitation based on existing controls and known vulnerabilities.

5. **Mitigation Planning:**  
   Develop targeted strategies to mitigate the worst-case scenarios by enforcing Zero Trust, strong AuthN/AuthZ, and continuous monitoring.

## Recommendations & Best Practices

- **Integrate Zero Trust Principles:**  
  Enforce authentication and authorization for every access request, regardless of source or location.
  
- **Continuous Monitoring:**  
  Deploy SIEM, endpoint detection, and real-time alerting to detect anomalies promptly.

- **Regular Red Teaming & Penetration Testing:**  
  Test defenses regularly with simulated attacks to validate and improve your threat model.

- **Adopt a DevSecOps Approach:**  
  Integrate security testing and threat modeling into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous improvement.

- **Automate Vulnerability Assessments:**  
  Utilize automated tools for ongoing vulnerability management, ensuring prompt remediation of identified issues.

## Conclusion

By understanding what an attacker might have at each stage—from reconnaissance to persistence—organizations can better anticipate worst-case scenarios. 
 This model emphasizes a Zero Trust architecture with strict authentication and authorization controls, ensuring that even if one layer is compromised, the overall security posture remains robust. 
    This systematic evaluation supports proactive threat mitigation and continuous improvement in defending public-facing SaaS applications and containerized microservices running on EKS.
