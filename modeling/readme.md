Our threat model combines elements of STRIDE, PASTA, and DREAD to ensure a secure, scalable, and resilient microservices environment in the cloud. 

The goal is to protect Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) by addressing potential attack vectors and establishing layered defensesâ€”especially focusing on service mesh security, 
 encryption (in transit and at rest), KMS for key management, and comprehensive monitoring.



# STRIDE:
Identifies threats based on:

Spoofing: Impersonation of services or users.

Tampering: Unauthorized modification of data.

Repudiation: Denial of actions taken.

Information Disclosure: Leaking sensitive information.

Denial of Service: Preventing legitimate use.

Elevation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized permissions.


# PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis):

A risk-centric approach that involves:

Defining business objectives and technical scope.

Decomposing the application architecture.

Identifying attack vectors using STRIDE.

Modeling potential attack chains.

Evaluating and prioritizing risks.

# DREAD:
A risk rating model evaluating:

Damage potential.
Reproducibility.
Exploitability.
Affected users.
Discoverability.

# Detailed Explanation

# 1. Define Business Objectives & Assets
Purpose: Identify critical data, services, and regulatory requirements.
Focus: Determine which assets (customer data, internal APIs, etc.) require strict confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

# 2. Identify Critical Assets & CIA Requirements
Confidentiality: Enforce encryption in transit (TLS/mTLS) and at rest; use KMS for secure key management.
Integrity: Use digital signatures, mTLS, and RBAC to prevent tampering.
Availability: Ensure redundancy, scalability, and robust DoS protections.

# 3. Decompose Microservices Architecture
Action: Map all microservices, container boundaries, and service mesh configurations (e.g., Istio).
Result: Clear understanding of trust boundaries and inter-service communications.

# 4. Map Data Flows & Service Mesh Boundaries
Action: Diagram how data moves between services, external clients, and data stores.
Result: Identify areas where encryption, authentication, and authorization are critical.

# 5. Apply STRIDE Analysis
Spoofing: Ensure strict identity verification via service mesh policies.
Tampering: Use secure channels and integrity checks.
Repudiation: Maintain robust logging and audit trails.
Information Disclosure: Implement least privilege access and data encryption.
Denial of Service: Design for auto-scaling, rate limiting, and resource quotas.
Elevation of Privilege: Apply RBAC and isolate sensitive components.

# 6. Simulate Attack Chains using PASTA
Process: Model realistic attack scenarios across your architecture.
Goal: Understand how an attacker might move laterally through your environment and identify choke points.

# 7. Evaluate Risks with DREAD Scoring
Assessment: Rate each threat based on potential damage, ease of exploitation, and the number of users affected.
Outcome: Prioritize threats that require immediate mitigation.


# 8. Prioritize Threats & Design Mitigations
Mitigations: Develop layered defenses such as:
Encryption: TLS for data in transit; disk encryption and KMS for data at rest.
Service Mesh Security: Enforce mTLS, mutual authentication, and network policies.
Access Control: Utilize RBAC and fine-grained IAM policies.
Logging & Monitoring: Use centralized logging (e.g., ELK, Prometheus) and set up real-time alerts.

# 9. Deploy Monitoring & Incident Response
Objective: Continuously detect, alert, and respond to anomalies.
Methods: Implement monitoring tools, anomaly detection, and automated incident response workflows.

# 10. Iterate & Refine Threat Model
Continuous Improvement: Regularly update the threat model as new vulnerabilities and attack vectors emerge.
Feedback Loop: Incorporate lessons learned from incident response and security audits.
