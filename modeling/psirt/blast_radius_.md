# ðŸ“˜ Blast Radius Calculus Runbook

## 1. Purpose

The goal of blast radius analysis is to **understand and limit how far an incident can spread** across:

* Systems (AWS accounts, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes clusters)
* Data (customer, internal, regulatory-sensitive)
* Business impact (customers, regions, products)
* Time (how long until recovery, how long exposure existed)

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Containment Before Measurement** â€“ stop the bleeding first.
2. **Breadth Over Depth** â€“ assess horizontally (whatâ€™s exposed) before vertical technical root cause.
3. **Customer-Centric View** â€“ always frame radius in terms of customers affected.
4. **Forward & Backward Analysis** â€“

   * Backward: How long exposure existed.
   * Forward: What could happen if not contained.

## 5. Blast Radius Checklists

### 5.1 Incident Commander Quick Checklist

* [ ] Have we scoped impacted accounts and services?
* [ ] Have we determined customer exposure?
* [ ] Do we know **when** exposure began and ended?
* [ ] Have we estimated data volume and sensitivity?
* [ ] Have we identified lateral movement paths (CI/CD â†’ prod, dev â†’ prod)?
* [ ] Have we flagged external reporting requirements?

### 5.2 Engineer Investigation Checklist

* [ ] Pull CloudTrail logs for IAM anomalies
* [ ] Review S3/RDS access logs for unusual queries
* [ ] Audit build artifacts for tampering (hash diff, SBOM)
* [ ] Inspect container images/pods for backdoors
* [ ] Correlate GuardDuty/Inspector alerts

## 6. Prioritization Integration

The blast radius directly informs remediation buckets:

* **Large blast radius + customer data exposed** â†’ ðŸ”´ Immediate
* **Limited radius but product integrity degraded** â†’ ðŸŸ  Short-term
* **Narrow radius, no customer impact** â†’ ðŸŸ¡ Medium-term

## 8. Example Walkthroughs

### Example 1: IAM Key Leak

* **Accounts & Regions**: 2 AWS accounts, us-east-1 + eu-central-1
* **Data**: Access to 3 S3 buckets with configs, no PII
* **Customers**: None directly affected (internal only)
* **Temporal**: Keys active 36 hours before revocation
* **Result**: Blast radius moderate â†’ ðŸ”´ Contain now, ðŸŸ  patch + rotate secrets

### Example 2: Poisoned Build Artifact

* **Accounts & Regions**: 1 CI/CD account, global impact via registry
* **Data**: No direct customer data exposure
* **Customers**: 200 customers potentially pulled image version `1.2.4`
* **Temporal**: Artifact live for 5 days
* **Result**: Blast radius large due to customer exposure â†’ ðŸ”´ Suspend builds, notify customers

## 9. Output for Communications

Blast radius must always be part of updates:

```markdown
[Update @ 15:30 UTC]
- AWS Accounts impacted: 2
- Regions: us-east-1, eu-central-1
- Data: Config files, no PII
- Customers: None confirmed
- Exposure Duration: 36h
```


## 10. Blast Radius Scoring Formula

We calculate a **Blast Radius Score (BRS)** to quantify scope:

```
BRS = Impact Ã— Likelihood Ã— Scope Ã— Duration
```

* **Impact (1â€“5)**

  * 1 = No customer exposure, minor internal
  * 3 = Product/service degradation
  * 5 = Customer PII/financial/regulatory data exposure

* **Likelihood (1â€“5)**

  * 1 = Requires highly specialized attack, mitigations in place
  * 3 = Exploitable with effort, no active exploit
  * 5 = Public exploit / active exploitation confirmed

* **Scope (1â€“5)**

  * 1 = Single service/region, isolated
  * 3 = Multi-service or multi-region, limited customers
  * 5 = Cross-region, multi-customer, systemic

* **Duration (1â€“5)**

  * 1 = <1h exposure
  * 3 = 24â€“72h exposure
  * 5 = Weeks/months exposure

---

### Example Scoring Table

| Factor     | Score | Notes                               |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| Impact     | 4     | Customer metadata + config exposure |
| Likelihood | 5     | Public exploit exists               |
| Scope      | 3     | Two AWS regions, limited accounts   |
| Duration   | 2     | 12h exposure                        |

**BRS = 4 Ã— 5 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 = 120**

---

### Interpretation

| BRS Range | Priority  | Bucket                   |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| **100+**  | Emergency | ðŸ”´ Critical Now          |
| **50â€“99** | High      | ðŸŸ  Short-Term            |
| **20â€“49** | Medium    | ðŸŸ¡ Medium-Term           |
| **<20**   | Low       | ðŸŸ¡ Medium-Term / Backlog |

## 12. Worked Examples

### Example 1: AWS IAM Key Leak

* Impact = 3 (infra control, no PII)
* Likelihood = 5 (active exploit risk)
* Scope = 2 (1 account, 1 region)
* Duration = 3 (48h exposure)
  **BRS = 3 Ã— 5 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 = 90 â†’ ðŸŸ  Short-Term (but ðŸ”´ containment required)**

### Example 2: Poisoned Artifact in Registry

* Impact = 4 (product integrity, customers exposed)
* Likelihood = 4 (exploitable, not yet abused)
* Scope = 4 (multi-region, 200 customers)
* Duration = 3 (5 days)
  **BRS = 4 Ã— 4 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 = 192 â†’ ðŸ”´ Critical Now**

## 13. Output for Comms

Blast radius scoring can be shared internally for clarity:

```markdown
[Update @ 17:00 UTC]
Blast Radius Score: 192
- Impact: Customer images pulled from poisoned registry
- Likelihood: Exploitable (no abuse confirmed yet)
- Scope: 200 customers, multi-region
- Duration: 5 days
â†’ Prioritized as ðŸ”´ Critical Now
```
