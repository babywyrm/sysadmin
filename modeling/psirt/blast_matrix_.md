# ðŸ“˜ Blast Radius Matrix & Scoring Runbook ..IRL..

This runbook defines a framework for analyzing, scoring, and prioritizing incidents by calculating their **blast radius**.  
It combines **quantitative rigor (scoring + matrix)** with **qualitative leadership strategies** (empowering people, right tools, burnout prevention).  

---

## 1. Core Formula

```

Blast Radius Score (BRS) = Impact Ã— Likelihood Ã— Scope Ã— Duration

````

- **Impact (1â€“5)** â†’ What happens if exploited?  
- **Likelihood (1â€“5)** â†’ How realistic is exploitation?  
- **Scope (1â€“5)** â†’ How wide is the blast radius?  
- **Duration (1â€“5)** â†’ How long exposure existed before containment?

## 2. Impact Ã— Likelihood Matrix

```mermaid

    title Impact vs Likelihood Matrix
    x-axis Likelihood -->  
    y-axis Impact -->
    quadrant-1 Low Priority
    quadrant-2 Watch / Track
    quadrant-3 Contain & Monitor
    quadrant-4 Critical Response
    "Cosmetic bug" : [0.2, 0.2]
    "Misconfig, no exploit" : [0.6, 0.3]
    "IAM key leak" : [0.8, 0.7]
    "Poisoned artifact" : [0.9, 0.9]

âœ… This 2Ã—2 chart provides a quick way to visualize incident placement.

## 3. Scope & Duration Modifiers

Even if an incident looks low/medium on the matrix, **Scope** and **Duration** can elevate it.

| Factor       | 1               | 3                            | 5                |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Scope**    | Isolated system | Multi-region / multi-service | Global, systemic |
| **Duration** | <1h             | 1â€“3 days                     | Weeks/months     |

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Misconfigured S3 bucket (Impact=2, Likelihood=3 â†’ Medium).
But Scope=5, Duration=5 â†’ Final Score = 150 â†’ **Critical Now**.

## 4. Priority Mapping

| **BRS Score** | **Priority** | **Bucket**      | **Response Strategy**                          |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **100+**      | ðŸš¨ Emergency | ðŸ”´ Critical Now | Contain immediately, rotate IC, legal+PR comms |
| **50â€“99**     | High         | ðŸŸ  Short Term   | Fix in days, notify customers if affected      |
| **20â€“49**     | Medium       | ðŸŸ¡ Medium Term  | Planned fixes, add monitoring                  |
| **<20**       | Low          | ðŸ“‹ Backlog      | Track for compliance/lessons                   |

## 5. Scoring Sheet (Detailed)

```markdown
# Incident Scoring Sheet

## Impact (1â€“5)
- What type of data/product affected?  
- Notes: ____________________________________________

## Likelihood (1â€“5)
- Is there a known exploit? Are mitigations in place?  
- Notes: ____________________________________________

## Scope (1â€“5)
- How wide is the blast (accounts, regions, customers)?  
- Notes: ____________________________________________

## Duration (1â€“5)
- How long has this been exploitable?  
- Notes: ____________________________________________

## Calculation
Impact Ã— Likelihood Ã— Scope Ã— Duration = _______

## Priority Mapping
Score: _______ â†’ [Critical Now / Short Term / Medium Term / Backlog]

## Strategic Notes
- Correct people in correct roles? [ ] Yes [ ] No  
- Right tools available? [Off-the-shelf / Custom / Hybrid]  
- Burnout rotation plan in place? [ ] Yes [ ] No  
```

## 6. Leadership Experience Notes

* **Empower people with right tools:**
  *Donâ€™t force-fit tools. Decide in discovery phase if you need to use what you have, buy off-the-shelf, or spin up a custom one.*

* **Correct triage with correct people:**
  *Cloud engineers handle IAM/key issues, CI/CD engineers handle pipeline tampering, researchers validate exploits.*

* **Prevent burnout:**
  *IC rotates every 4â€“6h, engineers every 8â€“10h max. Hand-offs use checklists.*

* **Containment first, remediation second:**
  *Stop the bleeding (revoke keys, kill pods) before patching or re-architecting.*

## 10. Key Takeaways

* **Quantitative Rigor**: scoring (BRS) makes prioritization objective.
* **Qualitative Leadership**: empower people, right tools, rotation, containment-first mindset.
* **Examples**: real-world container, supply chain, AWS, artifact incidents.
* **Visuals**: quadrant charts help communicate quickly to execs & engineers.
