# 🛡️ Enterprise Incident Response Runbook
**Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) Playbook**



Quick Reference: Incident Response Phases

Phase 1 — Detection & Initial Triage (0–30 minutes)

Confirm authenticity (rule out false positives)

Classify severity (SEV1–SEV4)

Spin up war room & assign roles

Begin containment for SEV1 immediately

Phase 2 — Containment & Blast Radius (30 minutes–4 hours)

Stop ongoing compromise and limit spread

Map blast radius (infra, apps, data, dev pipeline)

Preserve evidence in chain-of-custody format

Execute containment actions (rotate creds, isolate systems, block C2, etc.)

Phase 3 — Investigation & Forensics (parallel)

Reconstruct attack timeline

Identify root cause and persistence mechanisms

Collect volatile/system/network evidence

Coordinate with external forensics if needed

Phase 4 — Remediation & Recovery (hours → weeks)

Critical fixes (0–24h): containment, customer impact mitigation, hotfixes

Short-term (1–7d): patching, rotation, customer/regulatory notifications

Medium-term (1–4w): infra hardening, process/policy updates, monitoring upgrades

Long-term (1–6m): maturity improvements, vendor/partner security uplift

Phase 5 — Post-Incident & Continuous Improvement

Hot wash (<48h) & After-Action Review (<1w)

Document timeline, impact, lessons learned

Update runbooks, training, detection rules

Track action items (1w, 1m, 6m horizons)

## Overview & Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **Safety First**: Contain active exploitation before comprehensive analysis
- **Customer Impact Above All**: Prioritize based on customer data exposure and service degradation
- **Parallel Execution**: Investigation, containment, and communication run simultaneously
- **Evidence Integrity**: Preserve forensic evidence while enabling rapid response
- **Sustainable Response**: Build in rotation to prevent team burnout during extended incidents

### Success Metrics
- **MTTD**: Mean Time to Detection < 15 minutes (automated), < 2 hours (manual)
- **MTTR**: Mean Time to Response < 30 minutes (SEV1), < 2 hours (SEV2)
- **MTTC**: Mean Time to Containment < 4 hours (SEV1), < 24 hours (SEV2)

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Update Frequency | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| **SEV1** | Active exploitation, customer impact, data breach, product outage | 15 minutes | 30 minutes | Immediate exec notification |
| **SEV2** | High-risk vulnerability, potential exploitation, limited impact | 2 hours | 2 hours | VP+ notification within 4h |
| **SEV3** | Medium risk, mitigations in place, no immediate threat | 4 hours | 8 hours | Manager notification |
| **SEV4** | Low risk, cosmetic issues, theoretical vulnerabilities | 24 hours | Daily | Team notification only |

### Impact Classification Matrix

| **Impact Type** | **SEV1 Indicators** | **SEV2 Indicators** | **SEV3 Indicators** |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Customer Data** | Active data exfiltration, exposed PII/PHI | Potential access to customer data | Internal data exposure only |
| **Product Integrity** | Security controls bypassed/disabled | Security product degraded performance | Non-security product issues |
| **Availability** | Complete service outage | Partial service degradation | Single component affected |
| **Compliance** | Immediate breach notification required | Potential regulatory implications | Internal policy violations |

## Evidence Preservation

### **Digital Forensics Protocols**

#### **Evidence Collection Priority**
1. **Volatile Memory**: RAM dumps, running processes
2. **System State**: Registry, system files, temporary files
3. **Storage Media**: Disk images, database dumps
4. **Network Evidence**: Traffic captures, firewall logs
5. **Application Logs**: Security logs, audit trails

#### **Chain of Custody Requirements**
```markdown
**For each piece of evidence:**
- [ ] Unique identifier assigned
- [ ] Hash values calculated (MD5, SHA-256)
- [ ] Collection timestamp recorded
- [ ] Collector identification documented
- [ ] Storage location secured and logged
- [ ] Access log maintained
```

### **Legal Hold Procedures**
- Immediate legal hold notification for SEV1/SEV2 incidents
- Preservation of all relevant communications (Slack, email, documents)
- Coordination with Legal team for external disclosure requirements
- Documentation of all investigative steps for potential litigation

---

## Escalation & Legal Considerations

### **Escalation Matrix**

#### **Internal Escalation Triggers**
- **30 minutes**: No containment progress on SEV1
- **2 hours**: Unable to determine blast radius
- **4 hours**: Customer impact continues without resolution path
- **24 hours**: Investigation reveals potential criminal activity

#### **External Escalation Triggers**
- **Law Enforcement**: Evidence of criminal activity, nation-state actors
- **Federal Agencies**: Critical infrastructure impact, national security implications
- **Industry Partners**: Supply chain compromise affecting multiple organizations
- **Customers**: Confirmed or likely data exposure

### **Legal Considerations Checklist**
```markdown
- [ ] Attorney-client privilege preserved for sensitive communications
- [ ] Regulatory notification requirements assessed
- [ ] Customer contractual notification obligations reviewed
- [ ] Insurance carrier notification (cyber insurance)
- [ ] Third-party vendor notification requirements
- [ ] Public disclosure requirements evaluated
```
