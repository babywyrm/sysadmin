WordlistGPT Example
Features

    Use of ChatGPT to generate related words.
    Fast generation of uppercase variations, l33t variations and character insertions.
    Customizable word sizes, batch saving, and more.

Usage

Try wordlistgpt.py with 'harry potter':

git clone https://github.com/k4l1sh/WordlistGPT.git
cd WordlistGPT
python wordlistgpt.py -w 'harry potter'

You can also run directly from url if you are feeling lazy:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k4l1sh/WordlistGPT/main/wordlistgpt.py | python - -w 'harry potter'

A file named wordlist.txt will be created with the generated wordlist.

To take advantage of ChatGPT to generate related words, you need to get an OpenAI API key from OpenAI API keys.

After getting an OpenAI API key, create an .env file with API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here or run the script with OpenAI API key in the arguments --key your_openai_api_key_here.
Wordlist Generation Process

The Wordlist Generator follows a systematic process to generate a wordlist that is suitable for different purposes. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the wordlist is created:

    Words from GPT:
        For each word in the user-specified list, the generator makes an API call to OpenAI GPT, requesting related words.
        The generator adds the response from GPT to the wordlist.

    Word Cleaning and Adjusting:
        Subwords from each word are split and added to the wordlist.
        Non-word characters within the wordlist are stripped off, ensuring only clean words remain.

    Uppercase Variations:
        For each word in the wordlist, variations are created by changing the case of the characters.
        The variations are added to the wordlist

    Leet Variations:
        Leet variations are generated based on a predefined leet mapping.
        For each word in the wordlist, variations with leet characters are added to the wordlist.

    Insert Deterministic Characters:
        Deterministic characters, which are predefined sets of characters, can be inserted in the wordlist words.
        These characters can be added to the left, right, or nested within the words based on user-defined positions.

    Insert Random Characters:
        Random characters from a defined charset can be inserted into the words at random positions.
        The number of random insertions and the level of randomness are both defined by user parameters.
