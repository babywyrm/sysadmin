Creating a comprehensive SECCOMP (Secure Computing Mode) profile to enhance container security and prevent container escapes is a complex task. Below is an expanded SECCOMP profile that includes more protections to help improve container security. Keep in mind that this is a general example, and depending on your specific use case, you may need to further customize it.

```

  ]
}

```
In this expanded profile:

We've included additional system calls, such as setuid, setgid, chroot, capset, mknod, reboot, vhangup, and acct. These system calls are restricted to improve security.

We've also added comments to indicate where you can add more syscalls or customize the profile according to your specific needs. Depending on your application, you might need to include or exclude specific syscalls.

Please be cautious when implementing such restrictive profiles, as they can affect the normal functionality of containers. Always thoroughly test the profile to ensure it doesn't disrupt your applications.

Additionally, a comprehensive container security strategy should include:

Proper container isolation using technologies like Docker, Podman, or Kubernetes.
Network policies to restrict container network access.
Secure image management and ensuring images are from trusted sources.
User and group management to follow the principle of least privilege.
Regular updates, patching, and vulnerability scanning.
Monitoring and logging for security events.
Reviewing and updating security configurations based on changing threat models and requirements.
Security is an ongoing process, and the right security measures depend on your specific use case and risk assessment.
