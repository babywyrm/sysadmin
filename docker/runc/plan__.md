1. Adopt a Defense-in-Depth Strategy
Multi-layer Isolation:
Rely on container isolation plus additional layers. Containers (via runc) reduce the attack surface but aren’t foolproof. Consider running containers inside lightweight VMs (e.g., using Firecracker or gVisor) to provide an extra barrier between the host and potentially malicious code.

Minimize the Trust Boundary:
Assume that the container runtime or even the kernel might be exploited. Design your architecture so that even if one layer is compromised, damage is limited.

2. Harden runc Containers
User Namespaces:
Always run containers with unprivileged user namespaces so that processes inside the container run as non-root relative to the host. This prevents a container breakout from immediately yielding host-level root.

Seccomp Profiles:
Use a restrictive seccomp profile to filter out dangerous syscalls. Customize the profile to your workload (e.g., the needs of ChromeDriver) and ensure that syscalls known to be exploited are blocked.

Capabilities:
Drop all capabilities by default and only add back the ones absolutely necessary for your containerized workloads. For example, in many cases, the container won’t need capabilities like CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_NET_ADMIN.

Mandatory Access Control:
Use SELinux or AppArmor profiles to further confine what processes inside the container can do. This adds another kernel-enforced policy layer.

Read-Only Filesystems:
Run containers with a read-only filesystem where possible. If write access is needed in specific directories, use bind mounts with explicit permissions rather than giving blanket write access.

Resource Limits:
Set strict limits using cgroups for CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc., to mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) risks and prevent runaway processes.

3. Network and Runtime Considerations
Network Isolation:
Apply network namespace isolation and firewall rules (or use a service mesh) to restrict network access from the containers. For instance, limit outbound connections to only what’s necessary for your tests.

Ephemeral and Disposable Containers:
Use short-lived containers that are regularly torn down and replaced. This minimizes the window of opportunity for an attacker to persist after a breakout.

Monitoring and Logging:
Continuously monitor container activity and log syscalls, network traffic, and resource usage. Anomaly detection can alert you to potential escape attempts or misbehaviors.

Patching and Updates:
Keep the host kernel, container runtime (runc), and all security profiles up-to-date. Many exploits come from known vulnerabilities that have been patched.

4. Consider the Limitations of runc Alone
Low-Level Tool:
Runc is a low-level container runtime, so it won’t provide the additional safety features of a full container engine (like Podman or Docker) by default. Make sure your orchestration system (or your wrapper scripts) enforce the above policies consistently.

Sandboxing JavaScript Code:
If customers are bringing in their own JavaScript, consider running that code inside a further sandboxed environment (for example, using a dedicated JS sandbox or even a separate runtime environment) before passing it to ChromeDriver. This adds an extra layer of defense if the JS itself is malicious.

5. Test and Audit Your Security Posture
Penetration Testing:
Before going live, conduct rigorous penetration tests and security audits of your entire stack. Invite third parties to test for breakout scenarios.

Automated Security Tools:
Integrate container security scanners (such as Clair or Anchore Engine) into your CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities in container images.

Incident Response:
Prepare an incident response plan in case a breakout is detected. Know how to quickly isolate or shut down compromised hosts.
