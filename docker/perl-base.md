docker-perl-tester
This repo is used to build Perl Docker images with various pre-installed bits:

the aspell and aspell-en packages
cpanminus
App::cpm
Devel::Cover
various testing modules
Dist::Zilla with some common plugins (for Perl >= 5.20)
At this points images are refreshed daily, which could change overtime if it becomes an issue. This should guarantee you to test uptodate CPAN stack.

Note: if one dependency fails to install, this should not impact you as the image would not be published on failures.

devel build
Note that the devel build was added to test on the current Perl development version. (example: 5.37.8, ) This is tracking the last Perl devel version released.

OS flavor
At this time all the images built are based on buster distro.

Continuous Integrations
Using the images with GitHub Workflow
Here is a sample workflow for Linux running on all Perl version 5.8 to 5.38 You can save the content in .github/workflow/linux.yml.

Note: this example is using cpm to install the dependencies from a cpanfile. You can comment this line or use Dist::Zilla instead for supported Perl versions.

Using Helper scripts
The scripts from perl-actions/ci-perl-tester-helpers are available in the path of each container. These scripts can build and test dists for you in various scenarios. See https://github.com/Perl-Critic/PPI/blob/master/.github/workflows/dzil-build-and-test.yml for an example of how to use the helpers to build and tests a Perl distribution.

More Examples
You can find more details on how to setup GitHub workflow to smoke Perl projects by reading skaji/perl-github-actions-sample GitHub repository.

Using GitHub actions
You can also consider using GitHub actions:

perl-actions/install-with-cpanm
perl-actions/install-with-cpm
Building Docker images
When pushing to GitHub, it's using a GitHub action .github/workflows/publish-to-docker.yml to automagically build and publish the docker images for you.

If you consider cloning this repository, you would have to set in your GitHub repository the following secret variables, with some example values.

DOCKER_REPO=perldocker/perl-tester
DOCKER_USERNAME=username
DOCKER_GITHUB_TOKEN=a-token-or-password
Developer Notes:
The main branch is named main and not master.

Author
@oalders initiated the project and @atoomic tried to give it more public visibility volunteers/ideas are welcome to improve the project.
