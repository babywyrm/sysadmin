Each of these commands will run an ad hoc http static server in your current (or specified) directory, available at http://localhost:8000. Use this power wisely.

# Meta

If you have any suggestions, drop them in the comments below or on the reddit discussion. To get on this list, a solution must:

1. serve static files using your current directory (or a specified directory) as the server root,
2. be able to be run with a single, one line command (dependencies are fine if they're a one-time thing),
3. serve basic file types (html, css, js, images) with proper mime types,
4. require no configuration (from files or otherwise) beyond the command itself (no framework-specific servers, etc)
5. must run, or have a mode where it can run, in the foreground (i.e. no daemons)

Use --secure to automatically generate a certificate and serve on SSL (at https://localhost:8000).

With Sergio - a Kestrel wrapper using Argu:

This will serve the current directory at https://[::]:8080.

To specify listener details:

sergio --listener localhost 8080
To display all options:

websocat can serve specific explicit list of files on explicit URLs with explicit Content-Types.

websocat -s 1234 -F /index.html:text/html:./index.html -F /script.js:text/javascript:/path/to/thescript.js
There is no ability to automatically include more files based on existence on the filesystem, but sometimes 100% explicit approach may be beneficial.

Surprised that the once most universal thttpd wasn't even mentioned given how simple and convenient it is:

$ netstat -ltnp | grep thttpd

Node serve https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve much more professional that the other listed node.js options at this time.

Note that npm doesn't require you to install the package, so a true one-liner would be:

npx serve  --listen 8000
npx node-static -p 8000
npx http-server -p 8000
Thanks for the page!

wtarreau commented on May 14, 2021
@nilslindemann:

@wtarreau why?

Browsers' security is extremely brittle, and it's already extremely hard for them to protect themselves from abuses by rogue sites and fake ads or limiting the impact of poorly written plugins that always risk to be used to steal user information. By opening them to the outside world using an incoming connection, you're suddenly bypassing a lot of the isolation efforts made in the browser by immediately exposing the process to the outside world. You just need a small bug in the server or a small overlook in the isolation between the server and the rest of the browser and your browser's sensitive info such as passwords, cookies, certificates, or history can immediately leak, or some dummy certs and cookies, or trojans can be inserted.

@nilslindemann
nilslindemann commented on May 15, 2021
@wtarreau, Hmm, interesting. But isn't this an application which is isolated from the rest of the browser? Do you know of cases where what you described happened? Also, 400 000 users and no review which points out the dangers you described, and no attempts by google to block that app, all this indicates to me that it is not less safe than the other approaches documented here, is it?

For a ColdFusion / CFML powered web server in the current directory you can use commandbox:

box server start port=8123
The box binary (dependency) can be installed by running brew install commandbox or via several other methods: https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/setup/installation

Just found nws which supports basepath:

If you want all requests to resolve to a base path (i.e. http://localhost:3030/basepath) without having to place all files into a src/basepath sub-directory, use the -b flag:

nws -b basepath

Haskell, with just Cabal:

echo 'WaiAppStatic.CmdLine.runCommandLine (const id)' | cabal repl -b wai-app-static
It's a bit verbose, but on the plus side you're in a REPL, so it's easy to modify things.

Prompted by a question on Reddit.

This is off topic but if we upload an image to a reposiory, how do we associate it with a script, like for example a game has a character and a script, how do we do that?? also f4f?
