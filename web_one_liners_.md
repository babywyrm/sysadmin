Big list of http static server one-liners
web-servers.md
Each of these commands will run an ad hoc http static server in your current (or specified) directory, available at http://localhost:8000. Use this power wisely.

Discussion on reddit.

Python 2.x
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
Python 3.x
$ python -m http.server 8000
Twisted (Python)
$ twistd -n web -p 8000 --path .
Or:

$ python -c 'from twisted.web.server import Site; from twisted.web.static import File; from twisted.internet import reactor; reactor.listenTCP(8000, Site(File("."))); reactor.run()'
Depends on Twisted.

Sinatra (Ruby)

Plack (Perl)

Mojolicious (Perl)

No directory listings.

http-server (Node.js)
$ npm install -g http-server   # install dependency
$ http-server -p 8000
Note: This server does funky things with relative paths. For example, if you have a file /tests/index.html, it will load index.html if you go to /test, but will treat relative paths as if they were coming from /.

node-static (Node.js)
$ npm install -g node-static   # install dependency
$ static -p 8000
No directory listings.

No directory listings. /path must be an absolute path.

Meta
If you have any suggestions, drop them in the comments below or on the reddit discussion. To get on this list, a solution must:

serve static files using your current directory (or a specified directory) as the server root,
be able to be run with a single, one line command (dependencies are fine if they're a one-time thing),
serve basic file types (html, css, js, images) with proper mime types,
require no configuration (from files or otherwise) beyond the command itself (no framework-specific servers, etc)
must run, or have a mode where it can run, in the foreground (i.e. no daemons)

replace all of the npm install with npx for a oneliner, e.g. npx superstatic -p 8000

Note that if you want to share something with another machine, most of the solutions that bind to localhost or 127.0.0.1 won't work. Normally if you change localhost or 127.0.0.1 to 0, it will listen on all interfaces so you can download something from another machine.

E.g. change:

php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
to:

php -S 0:8000

With serverino:

Use --secure to automatically generate a certificate and serve on SSL (at https://localhost:8000).

With Sergio - a Kestrel wrapper using Argu:

This will serve the current directory at https://[::]:8080.

To specify listener details:

sergio --listener localhost 8080
To display all options:

You will need Tcl 8.6 with Tcllib 1.19 or later.

websocat can serve specific explicit list of files on explicit URLs with explicit Content-Types.

websocat -s 1234 -F /index.html:text/html:./index.html -F /script.js:text/javascript:/path/to/thescript.js
There is no ability to automatically include more files based on existence on the filesystem, but sometimes 100% explicit approach may be beneficial.

Lwan can be used as an one-liner web server, too: lwan -r /path/to/files/to/serve.

Surprised that the once most universal thttpd wasn't even mentioned given how simple and convenient it is:

$ thttpd
$ netstat -ltnp | grep thttpd
tcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      25130/thttpd

A listening socket is exactly the type of thing I wouldn't want to see in a web browser!

Node serve https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve much more professional that the other listed node.js options at this time.

Note that npm doesn't require you to install the package, so a true one-liner would be:

npx serve  --listen 8000
npx node-static -p 8000
npx http-server -p 8000
Thanks for the page!

wtarreau commented on May 14, 2021
@nilslindemann:

@wtarreau why?

Browsers' security is extremely brittle, and it's already extremely hard for them to protect themselves from abuses by rogue sites and fake ads or limiting the impact of poorly written plugins that always risk to be used to steal user information. By opening them to the outside world using an incoming connection, you're suddenly bypassing a lot of the isolation efforts made in the browser by immediately exposing the process to the outside world. You just need a small bug in the server or a small overlook in the isolation between the server and the rest of the browser and your browser's sensitive info such as passwords, cookies, certificates, or history can immediately leak, or some dummy certs and cookies, or trojans can be inserted.

@nilslindemann
nilslindemann commented on May 15, 2021
@wtarreau, Hmm, interesting. But isn't this an application which is isolated from the rest of the browser? Do you know of cases where what you described happened? Also, 400 000 users and no review which points out the dangers you described, and no attempts by google to block that app, all this indicates to me that it is not less safe than the other approaches documented here, is it?

For a ColdFusion / CFML powered web server in the current directory you can use commandbox:

box server start port=8123
The box binary (dependency) can be installed by running brew install commandbox or via several other methods: https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/setup/installation

Winstone, a wrapper around Jetty. Install:

Just found nws which supports basepath:

If you want all requests to resolve to a base path (i.e. http://localhost:3030/basepath) without having to place all files into a src/basepath sub-directory, use the -b flag:

nws -b basepath

Haskell, with just Cabal:

echo 'WaiAppStatic.CmdLine.runCommandLine (const id)' | cabal repl -b wai-app-static
It's a bit verbose, but on the plus side you're in a REPL, so it's easy to modify things.

Prompted by a question on Reddit.

This is off topic but if we upload an image to a reposiory, how do we associate it with a script, like for example a game has a character and a script, how do we do that?? also f4f?
