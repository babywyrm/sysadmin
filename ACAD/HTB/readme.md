# Pre-engagement 

educating the client and adjusting the contract. All necessary tests and their components are strictly defined and contractually recorded. In a face-to-face meeting or conference call, many arrangements are made, such as:

1.  Non-Disclosure Agreement
2.  Goals
3.  Scope
4.  Time Estimation
5.  Rules of Engagement



# Stage	Description

1.  Pre-Engagement	
The first step is to create all the necessary documents in the pre-engagement phase, discuss the assessment objectives, and clarify any questions.

2.  Information Gathering	
Once the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions.

3.  Vulnerability Assessment	
With this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions.

4.  Exploitation	
Once we have found potential vulnerabilities, we prepare our exploit code, tools, and environment and test the webserver for these potential vulnerabilities.

5.  Post-Exploitation	
Once we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations).

6.  Lateral Movement	
If other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered.

7.  Proof-of-Concept	
We create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger these vulnerabilities.

8.  Post-Engagement	
Finally, the documentation is completed and presented to our client as a formal report deliverable. Afterward, we may hold a report walkthrough meeting to clarify anything about our testing or results and provide any needed support to personnel tasked with remediating our findings.
