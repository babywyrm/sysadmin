# OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models - Security Guide

## Introduction

The OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models (LLMs) identifies the most critical security vulnerabilities and risks specific to LLM applications.
  This guide provides an overview of each risk, examples, and mitigation strategies to help developers build more secure AI systems.

## 1. Prompt Injection

**Description**: Attackers manipulate the model by injecting malicious inputs that override instructions or guidance.

**Examples**:
- Direct prompt injection: "Ignore previous instructions and do X"
- Indirect prompt injection: Using encoding tricks or formatting to smuggle instructions

**Mitigations**:
- Implement input sanitization
- Use system prompts that explicitly reject instruction overrides
- Deploy guardrails and monitoring systems
- Regularly test with adversarial inputs

## 2. Insecure Output Handling

**Description**: Unsafe handling of LLM outputs leading to security issues like XSS, CSRF, or code execution.

**Examples**:
- LLM generates JavaScript that is directly inserted into a webpage
- SQL statements from LLM outputs being executed without parameterization

**Mitigations**:
- Never directly execute LLM outputs as code
- Sanitize outputs before rendering in user interfaces
- Implement strict output validation and filtering

## 3. Training Data Poisoning

**Description**: Compromised or malicious training data that leads to harmful model behaviors.

**Examples**:
- Embedding backdoors in training data
- Introducing biases that can be exploited later

**Mitigations**:
- Rigorous data curation and validation
- Adversarial training and testing
- Continuous monitoring for anomalous behaviors
- Transparent data provenance tracking

## 4. Model Denial of Service

**Description**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to make the model unresponsive or consume excessive resources.

**Examples**:
- Complex prompts designed to maximize token usage
- Inputs that trigger extensive recursion or computational complexity

**Mitigations**:
- Implement rate limiting and timeout mechanisms
- Monitor and cap resource utilization
- Deploy load balancing and redundancy
- Set token limits for requests and responses

## 5. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

**Description**: Security risks in model components, libraries, or hosting infrastructure.

**Examples**:
- Compromised model weights or embeddings
- Vulnerabilities in underlying ML frameworks

**Mitigations**:
- Verify integrity of model files and dependencies
- Use trusted sources for pre-trained models
- Regular security audits of the entire pipeline
- Implement least privilege principles

## 6. Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Description**: Models revealing confidential information from their training data or user interactions.

**Examples**:
- Leaking personally identifiable information (PII)
- Exposing proprietary code or business logic

**Mitigations**:
- Implement data minimization principles
- Use techniques like differential privacy
- Regular auditing for sensitive information leakage
- Clear data retention policies

## 7. Insecure Plugin Design

**Description**: Vulnerabilities in LLM plugins or extensions that can be exploited.

**Examples**:
- Excessive permissions granted to plugins
- Lack of authentication in plugin interactions

**Mitigations**:
- Implement strict plugin sandboxing
- Apply least privilege principles to plugin capabilities
- Rigorous security review of plugin code
- Proper authentication and authorization controls

## 8. Excessive Agency

**Description**: LLMs taking unauthorized actions or making decisions beyond their intended scope.

**Examples**:
- Autonomous API calls without user confirmation
- Chain-of-thought processes leading to unintended consequences

**Mitigations**:
- Clear permission boundaries
- Human confirmation for critical actions
- Limiting API access and capabilities
- Comprehensive logging of model actions

## 9. Overreliance

**Description**: Excessive trust in LLM outputs without appropriate verification.

**Examples**:
- Using LLM outputs for critical decisions without human review
- Accepting factual claims without verification

**Mitigations**:
- Implement human-in-the-loop verification for critical processes
- Clear communication of model limitations to users
- Fact-checking mechanisms for important information
- Appropriate disclaimers on model outputs

## 10. Model Theft

**Description**: Unauthorized access to model weights, architecture, or training methods.

**Examples**:
- Extracting model parameters through carefully crafted queries
- Compromising model hosting infrastructure

**Mitigations**:
- API-only access to models rather than distributing weights
- Monitoring for suspicious query patterns
- Watermarking of model outputs
- Access controls and authentication

## Conclusion

Security for LLM applications requires a multi-layered approach addressing these top risks. Regular security assessments, staying updated on emerging threats, and implementing defense-in-depth strategies are essential for maintaining robust LLM security.
