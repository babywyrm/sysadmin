We define the AppArmor profile named docker-webapp for the process /usr/bin/docker-containerd, which is the entry point for Docker containers.
We allow read access (r) to common libraries, configuration files, and log files.
We allow network access for both IPv4 and IPv6, including various types of network traffic (inet, inet6).
We allow read-write access (rw) to specific directories like /app, /tmp, /proc/sys, and /dev.
We allow the execution of the web application binary (docker-containerd).
We allow DNS resolution by allowing read access to /etc/resolv.conf.
We allow access to necessary capabilities for the web application to function properly, including permissions to manage files and processes.
We deny access to all other files, directories, and resources by default.
