Google Authenticator (PAM Module):


# User-specific:

~/.google_authenticator

This is the default file where the Google Authenticator PAM module stores a user’s secret and configuration.

PAM_OATH (for OATH-based OTPs):

# System-wide (commonly): /etc/users.oath or /etc/oath/users.oath
These files (or similar paths) are often used by the PAM_OATH module to store secrets for all users, though the exact location may be set in your PAM configuration.
oathtool:

No fixed default:
The oathtool itself does not manage secret storage. Users typically store their TOTP secrets in a file of their choice (e.g., ~/.totp_secrets, ~/.config/oathtool/secrets, or similar).
Yubico Authenticator (Desktop Version):

User configuration: Typically under the user’s config directories such as

# ~/.config/Yubico/ or ~/.local/share/Yubico/

The exact file name may vary depending on the version and packaging.
LinOTP (if used on Linux for OTP management):

Configuration Directory: Often found in /etc/linotp/
(Note that LinOTP is a full OTP management system rather than a simple TOTP file store.)
Other Custom or Third-Party Tools:

Many desktop authenticators or command-line utilities use per-user configuration directories (e.g., ~/.config/<appname>/ or ~/.local/share/<appname>/)
Since there isn’t a universal standard, you should check the documentation for the specific tool.
In summary, for many Linux environments:

```
Google Authenticator PAM: ~/.google_authenticator
PAM_OATH: /etc/users.oath (or similar)
oathtool: User-defined (commonly something like ~/.totp_secrets)
Yubico Authenticator: Under ~/.config/Yubico/ or ~/.local/share/Yubico/
```




WinAuth:

Typically stores its configuration and TOTP secrets in the user’s application data folder.
Default location:
%APPDATA%\WinAuth\
You may find an XML or JSON file containing the secrets.
Authy Desktop:

The desktop version of Authy often uses either the roaming or local app data folders.
Common locations include:

```%APPDATA%\Authy Desktop\ or %LOCALAPPDATA%\Authy Desktop\ ```

KeePass with TOTP Plugin:

The TOTP secrets are stored within your KeePass database file.
The file’s location is user-defined (often in your Documents folder or a secure directory you’ve chosen).
Microsoft Authenticator (Windows version, if applicable):

Although primarily a mobile app, if you’re using a Windows version or a similar Microsoft authenticator, its data is often stored in a sandboxed location.
For example:

```%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsAuthenticator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\```

Note that these folders may require special permissions or tools to access.
Other Third-Party Tools:

Many other Windows TOTP utilities store their data within %APPDATA% or %LOCALAPPDATA% in a folder specific to the application, or even use the Windows Registry.

Check the documentation for the specific tool you’re using.
