    install homebrew if you have not already
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    install qemu
        brew install qemu

    extract the .ova file
        tar -xvf /path/to/ova

    convert the .ova file to a .qcow2 file
        qemu-img convert -O qcow2 /path/to/vdmk /path/to/output/qcow2
        make sure you have the .qcow2 extension in the output path
        there is no output until the processing is complete. it might take up to 5 minutes

    download utm

    make a new virtual machine in utm
        click the + icon on the top menu and then "start from scratch"
        go to the "drives" tab and click "import drive", then select the .qcow2 we just made
        in some cases you might have to disable uefi booting
            click on "system", then "advanced settings", and then unselect "uefi booting"
        by default, preformance is awful. to fix this you should give at least 6gb of RAM, 6 cores and enable mulicore mode
        click "save"

    start the virtual machine and enjoy x86_64 emulation on your m1 mac!

Question
Body

I am running some actions that have build steps using node-gyp. Node-gyp can build as x86_64 or arm64, but on my runner it is building as x86_64. My runner uses runs-on: macos-12. When I build the same project with the same settings on my M1 dev machine it builds as arm64.

How can I use a MacOS runner image that is M1 compatible?

You'll probably need to install node yourself, the default appears to be x86_64: actions/setup-node#462

Try using brew?

@jsoref I'm confused, macos-12 isn't an ARM runner so what would it matter how you try to install node?

How do you actually tell it to use an M1 runner? The github roadmap was updated yesterday to imply that M1 runners are in public beta and all you need to do is update your runs-on: but it doesn't say what to set it to and I can't find it otherwise.

So, the short of it is that at the time you could have self-hosted on an m1, but then you'd have to tell something you want to install the arm version (e.g. brew).

As for using the m1 runners from github, I'm sure they'll post a blog entry explaining how to select them.

- Docker on Vagrant
# minikube for Kubernetes cluster

### Vagrant

- Vagrantfile
  - Memory: more than 2048 RAM
  - [Docker - Provisioning | Vagrant by HashiCorp](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/docker) to install Docker

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/jammy64"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = 2048
  end
  config.vm.provision :docker
end
```

- Log in to the VM

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

### minikube && kubectl

[minikube start | minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

```
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

minikube start
```

[Install and Set Up kubectl on Linux | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

```

### actions-runner-controller

https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller#installation

- Change version (e.g. `v0.22.2`)
- `kubectl apply` fail, use `kubectl create` [ref](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/issues/1317#issuecomment-1092303292)

```
kubectl create -f https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/releases/download/v0.22.2/actions-runner-controller.yaml

### Single repository runner

- runner.yaml

```
# runner.yaml
apiVersion: actions.summerwind.dev/v1alpha1

metadata:
  name: example-runner
spec:
  repository: kyanny/test
  env: []
```

```
kubectl apply -f runner.yaml
```

```
kubectl get pod -A
```

- Unfortunately, after running job, `example-runner` pod got stuck in `NotReady 1/2` forever. Delete it and use `RunnerDeployments`.

```
kubectl delete -f runner.yaml
```

### RunnerDeployments

- runnerdeployment.yaml

```
# runnerdeployment.yaml
apiVersion: actions.summerwind.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RunnerDeployment
