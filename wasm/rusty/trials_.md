Use wasm-bindgen to Define Safe Interfaces:
Rust:

rust

```
// src/lib.rs

use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn process_data(data: &str) -> String {
    // Process data safely
    // For example, perform some computation and return the result
    let result = data.to_uppercase();
    result
}
```
JavaScript:

javascript

```
// index.js

import init, { process_data } from './dist/sandbox_project.js';

async function run() {
    await init();

    const input = "hello world";
    const result = process_data(input);
    console.log(result); // Output: "HELLO WORLD"
}

run();
```

In this example, we define a Rust function process_data that takes a string as input, converts it to uppercase, and returns the result. We expose this function to JavaScript using wasm-bindgen. In JavaScript, we call this function with some input data and receive the processed result safely.

Restrict Filesystem Access:
Rust:

rust
```
// src/lib.rs

use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// This function is safe because it does not access the filesystem
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn compute_square(num: i32) -> i32 {
    num * num
}
```
JavaScript:

```
// index.js

import init, { compute_square } from './dist/sandbox_project.js';

async function run() {
    await init();

    const result = compute_square(5);
    console.log(result); // Output: 25
}

run();
```

In this example, the Rust function compute_square simply computes the square of a number and returns the result. 
It does not perform any filesystem operations or access any external resources.

Disable Standard Library Features:
You can disable certain features of the standard library by configuring your Cargo.toml file:

toml
[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.74"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[profile.release]
# Optimize for small binary size
opt-level = "s"

# Disable default features to reduce binary size
default-features = false
By setting default-features = false, you can disable certain features of the standard library that are not suitable for the browser environment, such as filesystem access or threading.

Enable Appropriate Security Features:
You can enable security features such as Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in your HTML file to restrict the execution of scripts and enforce security policies within the browser environment. Here's an example CSP header:


##
##
##

<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self'">
This CSP header restricts the execution of scripts to only those hosted on the same origin as the HTML file.

Code Review and Auditing:
Performing code reviews and audits of your Rust code is essential for identifying and eliminating potential security vulnerabilities or unsafe operations. Ensure that your code follows best practices for security and does not contain any unsafe constructs or operations that could compromise the integrity of the system.
