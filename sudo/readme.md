# How To Create a Sudo User on Ubuntu 
The sudo command provides a mechanism for granting administrator privileges, ordinarily only available to the root user, to normal users. This guide will show you the easiest way to create a new user with sudo access on Ubuntu, without having to modify your server's sudoers file. If you want to configure sudo for an existing user, simply skip to step 3.

Steps to Create a New Sudo User
Log in to your server as the root user.
```
ssh root@server_ip_address
```
Use the adduser command to add a new user to your system.

Be sure to replace username with the user that you want to create.
```
adduser username
```
Set and confirm the new user's password at the prompt. A strong password is highly recommended!
```
Set password prompts:
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
```
Follow the prompts to set the new user's information. It is fine to accept the defaults to leave all of this information blank.
```
User information prompts:
Changing the user information for username
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
    Full Name []:
    Room Number []:
    Work Phone []:
    Home Phone []:
    Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]
```
Use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group.
```
usermod -aG sudo username
```
By default, on Ubuntu, members of the sudo group have sudo privileges.

Test sudo access on new user account

Use the su command to switch to the new user account.
```
su - username
```
As the new user, verify that you can use sudo by prepending "sudo" to the command that you want to run with superuser privileges.
```
sudo command_to_run
```
For example, you can list the contents of the /root directory, which is normally only accessible to the root user.
```
sudo ls -la /root
```
The first time you use sudo in a session, you will be prompted for the password of the user account. Enter the password to proceed.

Output:
[sudo] password for username:
If your user is in the proper group and you entered the password correctly, the command that you issued with sudo should run with root privileges.

====
BASH:
====

"$x" — ALWAYS PUT DOUBLE QUOTES AROUND VARIABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
       All variables in bash are global!!!!!!!
"$*" — Combines all the arguments into single word, separating them with first character of IFS variable. If IFS is not set, space is used. If IFS is null, no separator is used!!!!!!!!! No args provided will result in one empty string being passed on!!! 
"$@" — Use this instead!!!!! Will retain arguments as-is, so no args provided will result in no args being passed on. This is in most cases what you want to use for passing on arguments.
    Google: "$@" is right almost everytime, and $* is wrong almost everytime.
"$#" — Number of arguments
"$1" — First argument
"$0" — Name of the script
$'\n' — String literal with escape sequences (there is a backslash before n)
    If you want IFS to be a new line (useful with for loop) you need to: `IFS=$'\n'` - The dollar forces substitution!!!!!
    Also if you want 'while read line; do...' to preserve leading spaces and tabs, you need to set IFS=""
$? — Exit code of last command (0 - Success)
Ctrl-Z, kill %% — Kill looping bash script

test <expr> — Same as `[ <expr> ]`. Returns zero exit status if true.
    -n — Is string non empty

[[ <expr> ]] — Same as `[`, but without word splitting and filename expansion. And with additional operators: `&&`, `||`, `<`, `>` (lexicographic less, more), and also regular expression matching.
=~ — Regex comparison operator: `[[ "$HOST" =~ ^user.* ]]`
let <expr> — Executes expression: let a="$b"+2

$(command) — Same as `command`
eval <variable> — Execute string as command

read  -p <message> — Prompt for user input
var=${1:-"<default>"} — Setting variable with default value if $1 is empty
getopts — Parse parameters/arguments, builtin
getopt — GNU version is even better then getopts, not a builtin
while read line; do <commands>; done < <file> — Read from file line by line

<cmd> >&2 — Write to stderr
<cmd> 2>&1 | less — Add stderr to stdout and print it with less (useful for gcc)


ARRAYS AND LINES:
Reads line by line from variable. To preserve spaces use `IFS=`.
```
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "... $line ..."
done <<< "$list" — 
```
