Except it has been absolutely mutilated, and transformed into something pretty gross because you can just rewrite the SAML assertation and subsequent callbacks,
 The result being that you can pivot towards, and into, a target (victim) user, if the application in question isn't properly validating SAML assertations.
   Pretty gross, tbh.
