SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) and SSO (Single Sign-On) are two distinct but related concepts in the identity and access management space. Here's an example configuration for each:

Example Configuration for SCIM:

Suppose a company has an HR system that creates and manages employee accounts. To grant access to other systems and applications, the HR team needs to manually create user accounts in each system and assign appropriate access rights. This manual process can be time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in delays in granting access to new employees or revoking access for departing employees.

With SCIM, the HR system can be configured to automatically provision and deprovision user accounts in other systems and applications. For instance, suppose the company uses G Suite for email and document management. The HR team can configure the HR system to send SCIM messages to G Suite when a new employee is hired or an existing employee is terminated. G Suite will then automatically create or delete the user's account based on the message received from the HR system.

Example Configuration for SSO:

Suppose a company uses multiple cloud-based applications for its business operations, such as Salesforce for customer relationship management and Concur for expense management. Without SSO, employees need to remember separate login credentials for each application, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.

With SSO, the company can configure a single sign-on solution, such as Okta or Azure Active Directory, to authenticate users across all applications. When a user logs in to the SSO solution, they can access all configured applications without having to enter separate login credentials for each one. For instance, the SSO solution can be configured to authenticate users via a corporate directory, such as Active Directory, or via social media credentials, such as Google or Facebook.

In summary, SCIM and SSO are two different concepts that address different challenges in identity and access management. While SCIM automates the process of provisioning and deprovisioning user accounts and access rights, SSO simplifies the login process for users.
