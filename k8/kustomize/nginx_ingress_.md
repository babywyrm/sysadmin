Enable X-Forwarded-For Support in Nginx:
If your load balancer (e.g., ELB, ALB, or NGINX Ingress Controller) adds the X-Forwarded-For header, 
you can update the Nginx log format to show the original client IP from this header. For example, in an Nginx configuration:

```
log_format main '$http_x_forwarded_for - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;
```

This logs the X-Forwarded-For header, which typically includes the original client IP.

Use an Ingress Controller with Real IP Support:
If you’re using an Nginx Ingress Controller, you can enable use-proxy-protocol or configure 
externalTrafficPolicy to preserve the client IP (though this often works best with certain load balancers or specific node port services). 
For instance, if you set your Service’s externalTrafficPolicy to Local, the client’s source IP can be preserved:

```
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: webapp
```

Note: Setting externalTrafficPolicy: Local may reduce load balancing fairness, but it preserves client source IP.

Proxy Protocol:
Some load balancers support Proxy Protocol, which passes the original client IP at the TCP level. You’ll need to configure both the load balancer and Nginx to accept and parse this protocol.

Summary
The IP you’re seeing is the internal "last hop" IP due to Kubernetes networking and load balancing.
To get the real client IP, you need to rely on forwarded headers or configurations like externalTrafficPolicy: Local, X-Forwarded-For headers, or Proxy Protocol.
Adjust your Nginx log format or ingress configuration accordingly to expose the true client IP in the logs.

**Thought about Nginx log configuration** for a couple of seconds
Below is a more comprehensive approach to ensure that Nginx logs the original client IP rather than the intermediary load balancer or proxy IP. This involves adjusting both the Nginx configuration and your Kubernetes Service configuration (if applicable).

1. Understand the Network Flow
When using Kubernetes with a Service of type LoadBalancer, external traffic passes through:

The external load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB or ALB).
The Kubernetes Service, which may do additional load balancing via kube-proxy.
Nginx running in your Pod.
By default, Nginx only sees the immediate source address of the connection, which is often the node or proxy IP inside the cluster, not the original client IP.

To recover the original IP, the load balancer and/or ingress must pass it in an HTTP header (commonly X-Forwarded-For). Nginx can then be configured to use these headers as the “real” client IP.

2. Use ExternalTrafficPolicy: Local (Optional)
If you are not using an Ingress Controller and are directly exposing Nginx via a LoadBalancer Service, you can preserve the client source IP by setting externalTrafficPolicy: Local on the Service. This skips certain kube-proxy NATting, allowing the pod to see the original client IP.

Example Service:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp
  namespace: argo
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: webapp
```


Caveats:

externalTrafficPolicy: Local may reduce even load distribution if not all nodes have pods for this service.
Some load balancers (like AWS Classic ELB) may not always pass the original client IP without additional configuration.
3. Configure Nginx to Use Real IP Headers
Nginx has the real_ip module, which can be used to interpret X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-IP headers sent by upstream proxies or load balancers.

Nginx configuration snippet (e.g., in nginx.conf):

```
http {
    # Define which header is used to determine the real IP
    real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;

    # Define trusted proxy ranges. This is important to prevent spoofing.
    # You should restrict to the IPs or CIDRs of your load balancers and cluster nodes.
    # For a broad example (not recommended for production):
    set_real_ip_from 0.0.0.0/0;

    # Your existing server block
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name _;

        # Custom log format to include the real client IP
        log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                        '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                        '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;

        location / {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index index.html;
        }
    }
}
```


Key Points:

real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For; tells Nginx to look at this header for the original IP.
set_real_ip_from specifies which source IP ranges are trusted proxies. For production, specify the actual ELB/NLB IP ranges or known node CIDRs.
The log_format line includes $http_x_forwarded_for, which logs the original IP chain.
4. Using an Ingress Controller (If Applicable)
If you’re using an Nginx Ingress Controller (common in Kubernetes), it already sets and passes X-Forwarded-For headers by default. To preserve the client IP:

Set externalTrafficPolicy: Local on the Ingress Controller’s Service.
Configure the Ingress Controller’s config map to log X-Forwarded-For.
For the Nginx Ingress Controller, you can add annotations to your Ingress to ensure real IP is recorded:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: webapp
  namespace: argo
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-forwarded-headers: "true"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: webapp
                port:
                  number: 80

```


By default, the Nginx Ingress Controller uses the X-Forwarded-For header, and if use-forwarded-headers is enabled, it tries to honor that.

5. Validate the Setup
Check Logs: After applying these changes, run:

```
kubectl logs <webapp-pod> -n argo
