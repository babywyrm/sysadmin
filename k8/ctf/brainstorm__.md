1. Network Security and Isolation

Implementation:

Use Network Policies (via Calico, Cilium, or other CNI plugins) to restrict pod-to-pod communication.
Implement Istio or Linkerd for service-to-service mutual TLS (mTLS).
Isolate namespaces for different workloads.

CTF Challenge Ideas:
Misconfigured Policies: Deploy a namespace with overly permissive network policies. Challenge participants to pivot from one pod to another in a different namespace.
Service Mesh Bypass: Set up Istio with mTLS enabled but misconfigure a sidecar or allow plaintext traffic. Participants must bypass mTLS to access an internal service.


2. Pod Security
Implementation:
Enforce Pod Security Admission or legacy Pod Security Policies (PSPs) to limit pod capabilities (e.g., restrict privileged pods or root users).
Use tools like OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno to enforce additional constraints.

CTF Challenge Ideas:

Privileged Containers: Provide a container with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. Challenge participants to exploit it to escape into the host namespace.
Bypass OPA Policies: Configure OPA with a minor misconfiguration that attackers can exploit to deploy a malicious pod.


3. Image Security
Implementation:
Integrate image scanning tools like Trivy, Falco, or Clair to detect vulnerabilities.
Enforce signed images using Cosign or Notary.

CTF Challenge Ideas:
Vulnerable Image: Provide a pod with a vulnerable image. Challenge participants to identify and exploit the vulnerability.
Image Policy Bypass: Set up a weakly enforced policy where unsigned images can still be deployed if certain labels are present.


4. Runtime Security
Implementation:
Use Falco or Sysdig Secure for runtime threat detection.
Write custom rules for detecting unusual behavior, like reverse shells or filesystem access.


CTF Challenge Ideas:
Falco Evasion: Configure Falco rules with known weaknesses (e.g., poor syscall coverage). Participants must exploit the gap without triggering an alert.
Runtime Privilege Escalation: Start with a low-privilege container and escalate privileges without triggering Falco alerts.


5. Secrets Management
Implementation:
Use Kubernetes Secrets with encrypted storage (KMS).
Integrate external secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

CTF Challenge Ideas:
Secrets Exposure: Intentionally leak a misconfigured secret in the environment variables. Participants must extract and use it.
Vault Misconfiguration: Set up a misconfigured Vault server with overly broad policies. Challenge participants to steal other teamsâ€™ secrets.


6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Implementation:
Enforce least privilege by defining fine-grained RBAC roles.
Monitor API server logs for anomalous activities.

CTF Challenge Ideas:
RBAC Privilege Escalation: Assign an over-permissioned ServiceAccount to a Pod. Challenge participants to use it for privilege escalation (e.g., accessing sensitive secrets).
Token Stealing: Provide a pod with a mounted ServiceAccount token. Participants must exfiltrate the token and access the API server.


7. Supply Chain Security
Implementation:
Use Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to track dependencies and vulnerabilities.
Enforce CI/CD security checks (e.g., image scanning, policy validation).
CTF Challenge Ideas:
Backdoored Image: Provide an image with a backdoored dependency. Participants must find and exploit it.
Compromised CI Pipeline: Simulate a CI/CD pipeline where attackers can inject malicious code into a Helm chart or Docker image.


8. Cluster Hardening
Implementation:
Disable anonymous access and use audit logging.
Restrict access to the Kubernetes API server using network policies or Bastion hosts.

CTF Challenge Ideas:
API Exploitation: Simulate an exposed kubelet API or improperly secured etcd database. Participants must use it to escalate access.
Audit Log Analysis: Provide audit logs containing traces of malicious activity. Challenge participants to identify the exploit path.


9. Advanced Threats
Implementation:
Configure eBPF-based monitoring for advanced syscall-level visibility (e.g., Cilium, Pixie).
Use service meshes for fine-grained traffic policies.

CTF Challenge Ideas:
eBPF Exploit: Simulate an outdated kernel vulnerable to an eBPF-based attack. Challenge participants to write or execute a malicious eBPF program.
Traffic Spoofing: Provide a misconfigured service mesh where participants can spoof traffic to access restricted endpoints.


General Best Practices for the CTF
Progressive Difficulty: Start with simple challenges (e.g., extracting secrets from environment variables) and progress to more complex ones (e.g., exploiting misconfigured service meshes).
Visibility: Use tools like Prometheus/Grafana to provide visualizations or hints about unusual activity during challenges.
Documentation: Provide users with a concise explanation of the intended security mechanisms (so they can understand what they are bypassing).
