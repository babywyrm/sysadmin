To deploy Jenkins master on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), you'll need to perform the following steps:

Set up an EKS cluster:

Create an Amazon EKS cluster using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create an EKS cluster.
Set up kubectl and configure it to connect to your EKS cluster:

Install the AWS CLI and configure it with your AWS credentials.
Install kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool.
Configure kubectl to connect to your EKS cluster by running the command aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name>. This will update your kubeconfig file with the necessary cluster configuration.
Prepare Jenkins deployment files:

Create a jenkins.yaml file with the following Kubernetes Deployment definition:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: jenkins
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: jenkins
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: jenkins
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: jenkins
          image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
            - containerPort: 50000
          volumeMounts:
            - name: jenkins-home
              mountPath: /var/jenkins_home
      volumes:
        - name: jenkins-home
          emptyDir: {}
          
```

Deploy Jenkins:
Run the following command to deploy the Jenkins master:

```
kubectl apply -f jenkins.yaml
```

This will create a single replica Jenkins Deployment and the necessary volumes.

Expose Jenkins service:
Create a jenkins-service.yaml file with the following Kubernetes Service definition:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jenkins-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
    - port: 50000
      targetPort: 50000
      protocol: TCP
      name: jnlp
  selector:
    app: jenkins
```

Run the following command to create the Jenkins Service:

```
kubectl apply -f jenkins-service.yaml
```
This will create an AWS LoadBalancer service that exposes Jenkins on port 8080 for HTTP traffic and port 50000 for Jenkins agent communication.

Access Jenkins:
Run the command kubectl get services to get the external IP address of the Jenkins service.
```
Open a web browser and access Jenkins using the external IP address: http://<external-IP>:8080.
```
Follow the initial setup wizard to configure Jenkins.
That's it! You should now have Jenkins master deployed on your EKS cluster, and you can start using it for your CI/CD workflows.
