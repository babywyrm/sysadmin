Often times you need to inject a configuration file into a container in Kubernetes. This is really easy to do using the ConfigMap resource. But once in a while you might need to inject an executable script into a container.

There are any number of reasons why you might need to do so. In my case, I needed to alter the default behaviour of a Docker image. Normally you might create a new git repo with a Dockerfile and the script, and then build a whole new Docker image just to include the script. Instead you can inject an executable script into the container at runtime using a ConfigMap and the defaultMode of a volume.

The versions used in this post at the time of writing are:

    Minikube: 0.21.0
    VirtualBox: 5.1.22
    Kubernetes and kubectl: 1.7.0

Run it

Create a Kubernetes cluster with Minikube, clone the gist with example code, and run it. Note how the source of the ConfigMap is the wrapper.sh file.
$ minikube start
Starting local Kubernetes v1.7.0 cluster...
Starting VM...
Getting VM IP address...
Moving files into cluster...
Setting up certs...
Starting cluster components...
Connecting to cluster...
Setting up kubeconfig...
Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.

$ git clone https://gist.github.com/82c039843663de7e7f1e18bf4debe5fa.git inject-exec-script

$ cd inject-exec-script

$ kubectl create configmap wrapper --from-file=wrapper.sh
configmap "wrapper" created

$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
deployment "ghost" created

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ghost-3057289974-zvqm8   1/1       Running   0          30s

$ kubectl logs ghost-3057289974-zvqm8
Do my special initialization here then run the regular entrypoint

The Executable Script

In this case, the script is just a wrapper around the regular entrypoint for the ghost image that allows you to do some special initialization beforehand.
```
#!/bin/sh

set -euo pipefail

echo "Do my special initialization here then run the regular entrypoint"

exec docker-entrypoint.sh npm start

The Deployment

A volume is created from the ConfigMap with defaultMode: 0744, that’s what makes it executable. It’s then mounted to a /scripts dir but it could be mounted anywhere. The command: ["/scripts/wrapper.sh"] overrides the Docker image’s entrypoint and runs wrapper.sh instead.

First Crack

Before I found out about defaultMode, my first crack at solving this problem was to use an Init Container like this.
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ghost
  labels:
    role: blog
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        role: blog
      annotations:
        pod.beta.kubernetes.io/init-containers: '[
            {
                "name": "init-ghost",
                "image": "alpine:3.6",
                "command": ["sh", "-c", "chmod u+x /scripts/..data/wrapper.sh"],
                "volumeMounts": [{"name": "wrapper", "mountPath": "/scripts"}]
            }
        ]'
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ghost
        image: ghost:0.11-alpine
        command: ["/scripts/wrapper.sh"]
        ports:
        - name: ghost
          containerPort: 2368
          protocol: TCP
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wrapper
          mountPath: /scripts
      volumes:
      - name: wrapper
        configMap:
          name: wrapper

It gets the job done but defaultMode is a much more elegant and succinct way to do it.
Coda

You can inject any kind of text based file into a container in Kubernetes. Making it an executable script is just one special case of that. I like this approach a lot because you don’t have to create and maintain yet another Docker image just to inject one particular file.

P.S. I discovered that this is also extremely useful for extending the official Postgres image and creating scripts in the /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ dir of the Postgres container.
