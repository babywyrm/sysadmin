This is blowing my mind.

I built a quick #GPT4 program that creates its own code -> runs it -> bug fixes it -> and then adds new features to it... continuously... on loop... by itself. It just keeps on building ðŸ¤¯

THIS IS NOT MY CODE, I received it freely from Matt Duff. He was offing the code out for free.

I'm not going to change anything in this, so go ahead and copy and modify.

OpenAI-Code-Gen-and-Execution
This Python script utilizes the OpenAI API to generate Python code based on user prompts, execute the generated code, check for errors, and suggest new features while ensuring their correctness.

Features
Generate Python code using the OpenAI API
Execute the generated code and check for errors
Request new features from the OpenAI API
Add new features to the code and ensure their correctness
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
An OpenAI API key
Installation
Clone the repository:

Change the directory to the project folder:

Install the required packages:

Usage
Replace the "YOUR API KEY HERE" placeholder with your OpenAI API key in the openai.api_key variable.

Run the script:

Follow the prompts to generate and execute Python code.
