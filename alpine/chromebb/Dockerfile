Provide SECCOMP and AppArmor Profiles:

Create your own SECCOMP and AppArmor profiles based on the requirements of your application. Ensure that these profiles enhance security without impacting the functionality of your application.

Build the Docker Image:

Run the following command in the directory containing your Dockerfile:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t your-custom-image .
Run the Docker Container:

After successfully building the image, you can run a container based on your custom image:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name your-container -d your-custom-image
Adjust the docker run command according to your application's specific requirements.

Note: It's crucial to carefully craft SECCOMP and AppArmor profiles to balance security and functionality. The provided Dockerfile is a basic template, and you may need to customize it further based on your specific use case and application requirements. Always consider the security implications and thoroughly test the container in your environment.
