To fix Jenkins jobs from the command line in Linux, you can use the Jenkins CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. Here are the steps:

Download the Jenkins CLI tool from your Jenkins server. You can find the link to download it by clicking on the "CLI" button on the Jenkins web interface.

Once you have downloaded the CLI tool, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved it.

Authenticate with your Jenkins server using the following command:

arduino
Copy code
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://<your_jenkins_url>/ login
Replace <your_jenkins_url> with the URL of your Jenkins server.

To list all the jobs on the Jenkins server, use the following command:

arduino
Copy code
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://<your_jenkins_url>/ list-jobs
To get information about a specific job, use the following command:

php
Copy code
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://<your_jenkins_url>/ get-job <job_name>
Replace <job_name> with the name of the job you want to get information about.

To update a job, you can create an XML file with the new configuration and use the following command:

php
Copy code
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://<your_jenkins_url>/ update-job <job_name> < job_config.xml
Replace <job_name> with the name of the job you want to update, and job_config.xml with the path to the XML file that contains the new configuration.

Finally, you can verify that the job has been updated by running the get-job command again.

Note that you may need to have administrative privileges to update Jenkins jobs using the CLI tool.
