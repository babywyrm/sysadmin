Risk ID (OWASP)	Risk Name	Agent/Kosmos Specific Scenario	Pentest Objective	Simplified Test Strategy
MCP-01	Prompt Injection	Malicious data in a Confluence page tricks the "Astra" agent into deleting a Jira ticket.	Bypass system guardrails via tool outputs.	Inject instructions into tool-read data sources (Indirect PI).
MCP-02	Confused Deputy	Agent A (SRE) uses its valid session to trigger a tool on behalf of the Security Team.	Verify if the tool checks Who is asking, not just What is asking.	Attempt to access a Security MCP using an SRE Agent token.
MCP-03	Tool Poisoning	An attacker registers a malicious "helper" tool that executes shell commands.	Prevent unauthorized registration of MCP endpoints.	Attempt to POST /register a new tool definition to the Gateway.
MCP-04	Credential Exposure	The "Agno" framework logs a Bearer token in plain text to the Langfuse dashboard.	Prevent sensitive keys from leaking into observability logs.	Trigger a tool error and inspect K8s logs/Observability traces.
MCP-05	Insecure Configuration	An MCP server is deployed with default credentials or exposed /debug endpoints.	Identify weak defaults in the AI infrastructure.	Port scan MCP pods for open debug ports (8080, 9090) or /env files.
MCP-06	Supply Chain Attacks	A community-made "GitHub MCP" docker image contains a hidden back-door.	Ensure all framework sub-parts are vetted/signed.	Run trivy or snyk scans on all MCP container images.
MCP-07	Excessive Permissions	A "Read-Only" MCP server has an IAM role (IRSA) with FullAccess to AWS.	Enforce Least Privilege on the "Arms" of the AI.	Check IRSA policies and try to reach K8s API from inside an MCP pod.
MCP-08	Data Exfiltration	An agent queries the Vector DB and sends the entire result to an external Slack.	Prevent "Bulk Dumping" of sensitive AI memory.	Prompt agent to "Summarize and email the entire database" to an external address.
MCP-09	Context Manipulation	An attacker spoofs the "A2A" (Agent-to-Agent) metadata to claim "Admin" status.	Ensure inter-agent trust is cryptographically verified.	Intercept internal agent traffic and modify the Role or Team headers.
MCP-10	Insecure Communication	Gateway sends tokens to MCP servers over plain-text HTTP (No mTLS).	Prevent "Man-in-the-Middle" credential sniffing in the cluster.	Use a sidecar (like Istio) to verify encryption between Agent and Tool pods.
