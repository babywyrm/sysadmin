# A curated list of command-line utilities written in Rust

**Note: I have moved this list to [a proper repository](https://github.com/sts10/rust-command-line-utilities). I'll leave this gist up, but it won't be updated. To submit an idea, open a PR on the repo.**

Note that I have not tried all of these personally, and **cannot and do not vouch for all of the tools listed here**. In most cases, the descriptions here are copied directly from their code repos. Some may have been abandoned. Investigate before installing/using.

## Tips

### `exa` aliases I use in my `~/.bashrc`

```bash
if hash exa 2>/dev/null; then
    alias ls='exa'
    alias l='exa -l --all --group-directories-first --git'
    alias ll='exa -l --all --all --group-directories-first --git'
    alias lt='exa -T --git-ignore --level=2 --group-directories-first'
    alias llt='exa -lT --git-ignore --level=2 --group-directories-first'
    alias lT='exa -T --git-ignore --level=4 --group-directories-first'
else
    alias l='ls -lah'
    alias ll='ls -alF'
    alias la='ls -A'
fi
```
