# Hypothetical


# 1. mTLS and TLS Termination
Ambassador supports mutual TLS out of the box, which can enforce secure connections from the client to Ambassador and from Ambassador to upstream services (like Billing).
This eliminates the gap where your current Gateway does not use TLS between Gateway → Billing Service.
Ambassador can handle certificate management, certificate rotation, and policy-based TLS settings more easily than a DIY approach in a custom gateway.


# 2. Rate Limiting & DoS Protections
Ambassador has built-in rate-limiting features or can integrate with external rate-limiting solutions (like Envoy’s rate limit service).
You can define global or per-user rate limits, concurrency limits, or even dynamic throttles.
This helps prevent the scenario where an attacker bypasses your Gateway or floods the Billing Service.
By pushing rate limiting to Ambassador, you ensure that all inbound traffic must pass the same enforcement points.


# 3. Authentication & Authorization
Ambassador can integrate with various identity providers (e.g., OAuth2, OIDC, JWT validation) to handle both authentication and authorization.
JWT Validation: Ambassador can inspect tokens, verify signatures, check expiration, etc.—before the request ever reaches your Billing Service.
RBAC: If you store org/user relationships in an external identity management solution, Ambassador can do a preliminary check to see if a user is allowed to access a specific route or resource.
This approach offloads auth logic from your microservices, ensuring a consistent and centralized security policy.


# 4. Replay Protection & Short-Lived Tokens
If you implement short-lived JWTs with a jti (token ID) claim:
Ambassador can verify tokens against a central introspection endpoint or an authentication service.
You can configure Ambassador to reject tokens that are expired or otherwise invalid.
This eliminates the need for each microservice to implement custom replay protection logic, though you might still want to store a server-side blacklist (or token revocation list).
Ambassador can also handle more advanced patterns like nonce or request signing by delegating to an external auth service.


# 5. Service-to-Service Authentication
Beyond user auth, you can configure mTLS or additional token-based authentication for internal service calls.
For example, the “downstream” call from Ambassador to Billing could require a known service account token or mutual TLS with pinned certificates.
This ensures that only Ambassador (and not an external attacker) can reach the Billing Service.


# 6. Centralized Policy Management
One key benefit of an API Gateway like Ambassador is the centralization of policies:
You define your security rules (ratelimiting, auth, routing, etc.) in Ambassador’s configuration, which can be version-controlled and reviewed.
Teams can apply changes to policy quickly without redeploying the underlying services.


# 7. Integration with Observability / Logging
Ambassador integrates well with logging/metrics stacks:
You get consistent logs of who called which route, with what token, at what time, etc.
You can forward logs to a SIEM or monitoring system to detect anomalies (e.g., repeated 4XX or 5XX errors).
This can complement your existing Billing Logs approach by having two data points: gateway logs (external) and application logs (internal).
Implementation Considerations & Level of Effort
Deployment Model

Kubernetes: Ambassador is commonly used as an Ingress Controller or an “Edge Stack” in Kubernetes environments. If you’re already containerized/K8s, it’s simpler to integrate.
Non-Kubernetes: Ambassador can still run in VMs or container orchestration systems, but you’ll need to handle network routing carefully.
Configuration & Migration

You’ll need to migrate from your existing gateway logic (rate limiting, etc.) into Ambassador’s config.
Testing is crucial: ensure your routes, rewrites, timeouts, and security policies align with existing business logic.
AuthN / AuthZ Strategy

Decide whether you want Ambassador to do all authentication checks or only certain validations (like JWT signature/expiration).
You may still want your Billing Service to do final, fine-grained authorization checks (i.e. “Is user X allowed to update org Y’s card?”). But Ambassador can block obviously invalid requests.


# mTLS Setup

You must have a plan for certificate management (internal PKI, Vault PKI, or something similar).
Ambassador can automate certificate rotation if integrated with a cert manager or Vault plugin.
This step typically requires 2–4 sprints depending on your environment’s complexity (network, DNS, firewall rules, etc.).


# Performance & Scalability


Ambassador is built on top of Envoy Proxy, which is high-performance.
Ensure you have enough resources for Ambassador to handle your peak traffic.
You might introduce a separate rate-limiting service if you require advanced or distributed rate-limiting logic.
Trade-Offs / Pitfalls
Over-reliance on the Gateway
Even with Ambassador, you still want defense in depth. The Billing Service must do its own minimal checks (like “this token claims an org, but does the DB say the user is an admin for that org?”).
Configuration Complexity
Ambassador’s CRDs and configuration can be extensive. Proper version-control, a clear policy for changes, and developer training are key.
Tokenization & PCI
Replacing the Gateway alone doesn’t solve the underlying PCI challenges if you still store raw card data. You still need to address tokenization or remove the CVV, etc.


# Summary of Ambassador’s Value Proposition


By replacing or enhancing your current Gateway service with Ambassador, you can:
```
Centralize TLS enforcement, including mTLS for internal calls.
Offload rate limiting and authentication from your microservices to a robust, proven layer.
Implement advanced authorization checks, token validation, and potential replay protection.
Simplify observability and logs integration for compliance and debugging.
