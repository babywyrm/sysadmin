Converting a standard module in Puppet to a YAML module for modern Puppet involves a few steps:

Create a new directory for your YAML module in your Puppet module path. For example, if your standard module is located in /etc/puppet/modules/mymodule, create a new directory /etc/puppet/modules/mymodule_yaml.

Copy the metadata.json file from your standard module to your new YAML module directory.

Create a data directory in your new YAML module directory. This directory will contain your YAML data files.

Move any existing YAML data files from your standard module's manifests directory to your new YAML module's data directory. For example, if your standard module has a data file /etc/puppet/modules/mymodule/manifests/data.yaml, move it to /etc/puppet/modules/mymodule_yaml/data/mymodule.yaml.

Create a new file in your YAML module's manifests directory that includes your YAML data. For example, create a file /etc/puppet/modules/mymodule_yaml/manifests/init.pp with the following content:

kotlin
Copy code
class mymodule {
  $data = lookup('mymodule::data', {'default_value' => {}})
  ...
}
Use the $data variable in your Puppet code to access your YAML data.

Modify any existing Puppet code in your standard module to use the $data variable instead of hardcoding data values.

Test your YAML module to make sure it works as expected.

Note that converting a standard module to a YAML module may require significant changes to your Puppet code, especially if your standard module relied heavily on hardcoded data values. It's also worth noting that YAML data can be more difficult to manage than Puppet code, so it's important to make sure you have a good understanding of YAML best practices before converting your module.
