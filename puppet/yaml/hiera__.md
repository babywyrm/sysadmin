In Puppet, YAML files are often used as data sources for Hiera, a tool for managing and separating configuration data from Puppet code.

Here's how it works:
```

Hiera is configured to look for data in specific YAML files. For example, you might configure Hiera to look for data in a file called common.yaml or webserver.yaml.

In your Puppet code, you can use Hiera to look up values from those YAML files. For example, you might use the lookup() function to get the value of a variable defined in a YAML file.

When Puppet runs, it checks the YAML files specified by Hiera and pulls in any data that matches the lookup key.

Puppet then uses that data in your code. For example, you might use the data to set the value of a variable or parameter.
```

So, to answer your question, 
a YAML file Puppet module works with Hiera by providing configuration data in the form of YAML files that can be looked up by Hiera and used in Puppet code. 
This allows for easy separation of configuration data from code, making it easier to manage and update your infrastructure.



In Puppet, it's common to organize configuration data using Hiera and YAML files. These YAML files can be included in a Puppet module to provide data for that module's classes and resources.

Here's an example of how you might do this:

Create a YAML file with your configuration data. For example, let's say you have a module that configures Nginx, and you want to define the port number that Nginx listens on. You could create a YAML file called nginx.yaml with the following contents:

```
nginx::port: 8080
```
This sets the nginx::port parameter to 8080.

In your Puppet module, create a data directory at the top level. This directory will contain your YAML files.

Move your nginx.yaml file into the data directory.

In your Puppet module's manifests directory, create a class file that uses the data defined in your YAML file. For example, you might create a file called nginx.pp with the following contents:

```
class nginx {
  $port = lookup('nginx::port')

  # ...rest of your Nginx configuration code...
}
```
Here, we're using the lookup() function to retrieve the value of nginx::port from our nginx.yaml file.

When you include the nginx class in your Puppet code, the lookup() function will retrieve the value of nginx::port 
from the nginx.yaml file and set the $port variable to 8080.

That's the basic idea of how you can import YAML files into your Puppet module as configuration data using Hiera. 
You can add more YAML files to the data directory as needed, and use the lookup() function to retrieve their values in your Puppet code.

# Docker/Hiera

Here's an example of a Puppet module that uses YAML to supply secrets for a Docker image.

Create a YAML file with your secret data. For example, let's say you have a Docker image that requires a password to run, and you want to supply that password using a YAML file. You could create a YAML file called secrets.yaml with the following contents:

```
docker_password: "mysecretpassword"
```

This sets the docker_password parameter to mysecretpassword.

In your Puppet module, create a data directory at the top level. This directory will contain your YAML files.

Move your secrets.yaml file into the data directory.

In your Puppet module's manifests directory, create a class file that uses the secret data defined in your YAML file. For example, you might create a file called docker.pp with the following contents:

```
class docker {
  $docker_password = lookup('docker_password')

  # Pull the Docker image
  docker::image { 'myimage':
    image   => 'myimage:latest',
    require => File['/usr/local/bin/docker-login.sh'],
  }

  # Start the Docker container
  docker::run { 'mycontainer':
    image   => 'myimage:latest',
    env     => "DOCKER_PASSWORD=$docker_password",
    require => Docker::Image['myimage'],
  }
}
```
Here, we're using the lookup() function to retrieve the value of docker_password from our secrets.yaml file. We then use that value as an environment variable (DOCKER_PASSWORD) when starting the Docker container.

When you include the docker class in your Puppet code, the lookup() function will retrieve the value of docker_password from the secrets.yaml file and set the $docker_password variable to mysecretpassword.

That's the basic idea of how you can use YAML files to supply secrets for a Docker image in your Puppet module. You can add more secrets to the secrets.yaml file as needed, and use the lookup() function to retrieve their values in your Puppet code.
