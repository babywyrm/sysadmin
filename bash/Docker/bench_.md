What is Docker-bench?
The Docker-bench for Security tool is an open-source script which analyzes numerous standard best-practices when deploying Docker containers in a production environment. The fully automated tests are designed to locate issues with your configuration based on the CIS Docker Benchmark v1.3.1 standards. These tests are fully automated and allow users to self-assess the hosts and the docker containers where they reside.

Prerequisites
A running instance of Docker on your server
An administrative user with elevated permissions or a user associated with the docker group
Docker 1.13.0≥ (If a distribution does not utilize auditctl, the included audit tests will check the /etc/audit/audit.rules file to see if a rule is present instead)
Installation
There are two methods to install and run Docker bench. The primary method is to use the git clone command to replicate the script locally, and the second is to run a containerized version of the script.

Clone
Run the git clone command to replicate the script. Once it is downloaded, cd into the cloned folder and run the script.

Bash
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security
sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh
Copy
Bash
```
docker run --rm --net host --pid host --userns host --cap-add audit_control \
​
    -e DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=$DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST \
    -v /etc:/etc:ro \
    -v /usr/bin/containerd:/usr/bin/containerd:ro \
    -v /usr/bin/runc:/usr/bin/runc:ro \
    -v /usr/lib/systemd:/usr/lib/systemd:ro \
    -v /var/lib:/var/lib:ro \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    --label docker_bench_security \
    docker/docker-bench-security
```
Copy
Docker Container
Warning
The containerized docker script requires elevated privilege to run since it employs the host's filesystem, pid and network namespaces because components of the benchmark will apply to the running host.

The second method to run the script uses a small, prepackaged docker container. This is the easiest way to run Docker Bench against your hosts. Adjusting the shared volumes is also required depending on the OS where the script is run*.

Building the Docker Image
Users have two choices when creating the docker image, using git clone or docker composed. Both methods are noted below.

Bash
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security
docker build --no-cache -t docker-bench-security .
Copy
Bash
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security
docker-compose run --rm docker-bench-security
Copy
Running the Script
Bash
sh docker-bench-security.sh
Copy
Script Options
Bash
```
docker-bench-security.sh -h 
​
  -b           optional  Do not print colors
  -h           optional  Print this help message
  -l FILE      optional  Log output in FILE, inside container if run using docker
  -u USERS     optional  Comma delimited list of trusted docker user(s)
  -c CHECK     optional  Comma delimited list of specific check(s) id
  -e CHECK     optional  Comma delimited list of specific check(s) id to exclude
  -i INCLUDE   optional  Comma delimited list of patterns within a container or image name to check
  -x EXCLUDE   optional  Comma delimited list of patterns within a container or image name to exclude from check
  -n LIMIT     optional  In JSON output, when reporting lists of items (containers, images, etc.), limit the number of reported items to LIMIT. Default 0 (no limit).
  -p PRINT     optional  Disable the printing of remediation measures. Default: print remediation measures.
```
Copy
By default, Docker Bench will run all available CIS tests. This will produce two main logs within a log folder in the current directory. Below are the log names.

docker-bench-security.sh.log.json
docker-bench-security.sh.log.
When the docker container is used, the log files will be created inside the container in location /usr/local/bin/log/. If users wish to access them from the host after the container has been run, a mounted storage volume is required.

Results
The output of the script is broken down into five main areas. Each section address a different area of concern.

Host Configuration
Docker Daemon Configuration
Docker Daemon Configuration Files
Container Images and Build Files
Container Runtime
In each of these areas, the tests will return one of three outcomes; Info, Warning, or Pass.


After each check, feedback is provided for each of the configuration recommendations. In these findings, users can leverage the original benchmark document to remedy any issues. Additional testing options can be found on the related GitHub page.
