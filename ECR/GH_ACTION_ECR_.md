Pubstack, my current client decided to migrate all its docker images to ECR.

With the recent announcement about rate limiting on Docker Hub, maybe we will not be the only ones moving away.

For our CI/CD pipelines we use both CircleCI and GitHub Actions.

Using an ECR image is a really simple task in CircleCI, it consists of adding the aws_auth to the image configuration.

  docker:
    - image: ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/IMAGE:VERSION
      aws_auth:
        aws_access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        aws_secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

On the other hand, using ECR images in GitHub Actions was a bit more tricky.

The problem is, you could only use images from private registries in job and service containers since late september, and they only did the “credentials” implementation. It means something like this is expected:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/IMAGE:VERSION
      credentials:
        username: AWS
        password: ${{ secrets.ECR_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "inside an ecr container"

With aws, you can get a password with aws ecr get-login-password, and it is valid 12 hours.

You can manually set the GitGub secret “ECR_PASSWORD” every 12 hours, but that’s not really convenient.

After a little digging, I found an answer on a GitHub community thread explaining what seems like a good solution.1

Basically what we will do is:

    Retrieve ECR password from aws
    Store it as a GitHub secret name ECR_PASSWORD

All that inside a GitHub action scheduled to run every 6 hours.

It was not really as simple as I first thought, so here is all I had to do. I hope it can help you.

First, I created some aws credentials (ie. a couple aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key with enough right to pull from ECR) I put them as secrets inside the GitHub project, let’s call them AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. Then I generated a personal access token (the “provided by default” GITHUB_TOKEN doest not have sufficient rights), let’s call it GH_API_ACCESS_TOKEN.

The complete GitHub workflow:

name: ecr-login
on:
  # Every 6 hours, the password validity is 12 hours
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 */6 * * *'
jobs:
  login:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: AWS cli install action
        uses: chrislennon/action-aws-cli@1.1
      - name: retrieve ecr password and store as secret
        run: |
          pip3 install -r .github/requirements.txt
          python3 .github/ecr_password_updater.py
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: AWS_REGION
          GH_API_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_API_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  # This 'test' job is usefull for fast debugging
  test:
    needs: login
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/IMAGE:VERSION
      credentials:
        username: AWS
        # Here is the password retrieved as a secret that is set by the `login` job
        password: ${{ secrets.ECR_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "Inside a container pulled from ECR \o/"

The python file ecr_password_updater.py:

    sealed_box = public.SealedBox(public_key)
    encrypted = sealed_box.encrypt(secret_value.encode("utf-8"))
    return b64encode(encrypted).decode("utf-8")

    ecr = boto3.client('ecr')
    response = ecr.get_authorization_token()

    decoded_login_password = b64decode(encoded_login_password).decode('UTF-8')
    return decoded_login_password.split(':')[1]

    encrypted_password = encrypt(public_key_value, password)
    update_password = requests.put('https://api.github.com/repos/ORG/REPOSITORY/actions/secrets/ECR_PASSWORD',

                                   data=json.dumps({'encrypted_value': encrypted_password, 'key_id': public_key_id,

    if update_password.ok is False:
        print('could not update password')
        print(update_password.text)
        exit(1)

The dependencies used by the python code:

pynacl==1.4.0
requests==2.25.1
boto3==1.17.107

I first started with a simple bash script, but it became quite complex2, so I switched to python.

Enjoy!

Thanks to Alex Pavlenko, I switched from using the aws cli to boto3. Python all the way!

    ok, maybe not good, but at least it works ↩

    you need to encrypt the password, and you need the public key id of the repository when you put the encrypted secret. I often start with bash, if it’s simple enough I keep it, if not I switch to python. ↩
