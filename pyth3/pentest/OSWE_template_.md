# OSWE Exam Report

## Introduction

The Offensive Security OSWE exam report contains all efforts that were conducted
in order to pass the Offensive Security Web Expert exam. This report will be
graded from a standpoint of correctness and fullness to all aspects of the exam.
The purpose of this report is to ensure that the student has the technical
knowledge required to pass the qualifications for the Offensive Security Web
Expert certification.

## Objective

The objective of this assessment is to perform a white-box penetration against
the Offensive Security Exam network. The student is tasked with following
methodical approach in obtaining access to the objective goals. This test should
simulate an actual white-box penetration test with Proof of Concept and how you
would start from beginning to end, including the overall report.

## Requirements

The student will be required to fill out this exam documentation fully and to
include the following sections:

- Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken
- Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code, and
  proof.txt if applicable.
- Any additional items that were not included

# High-Level Summary

In the 48 hours between [2020-01-01 10:00] to [2020-01-03 10:00] the student was
tasked with performing a white-box penetration test towards Offensive Security
Exam containing [#] applications.

A white-box penetration test is sifting through the massive amount of data
available to identify potential points of weakness. The focus of this test is to
provide a comprehensive assessment of both internal and external
vulnerabilities. The student's overall objective was to evaluate the
application, identify vulnerabilities, and write automated exploit while
reporting the findings back to Offensive Security.

When performing the white-box penetration test, there were several critical
vulnerabilities that were identified on Offensive Security's network. When
performing the attacks, the student was able to gain access to multiple
machines, primarily due to design flaws and implementation errors. On [#] out of
[#] servers, full shell access was achieved. These systems as well as a brief
description on how access was obtained are listed below:

- **Application (192.168.x.x)** - Short summary of the exploit path
- **Application (192.168.x.x)** - Short summary of the exploit path
- **Application (192.168.x.x)** - Short summary of the exploit path

Full details can be found in the Whitebox audit section and scripts to
automatically exploit the identified vulnerabilities can be found amongst the
Appendixes.

## Recommendations

We recommend patching the vulnerabilities identified during the testing to
ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future. One thing to
remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched,
should remain on a regular patch program to protect additional vulnerabilities
that are discovered at a later date.

# Whitebox audit

The penetration testing portions of the assessment focus heavily on gaining
access to a variety of systems. During this penetration test, the student was
able to successfully gain full access to X out of the Y systems.

## Application (192.168.x.x)

The application is a custom web application written in [language]. The
application [provides the following functionality and users].

During the testing, the student was provided with unauthenticated access to the
application. [The server was configured with debug functionality]. A number of
vulnerabilities were found in the application, ranging from [XSS] to [RCE],
allowing the student to achieve full control of the application and underlying
server.

Each found vulnerability is described in detail below, a script to automatically
exploit the server can be found in appendix *Appendix - Full script for
[application] exploitation*.

### Proof of exploitation

The following sensitive files were extracted from the server, as proof of
successful exploitation;

**`local.txt`** - `MakeSureToEndLineWithTwoSpaces`  
**`proof.txt`** - `OrElseItWillEndUpOnOneLine`  

![local.txt](img/placeholder-image-300x225.png)

![proof.txt](img/placeholder-image-300x225.png){ width=250px }

### Vuln

```default
