Modules make writing Python applications easy and straightforward, but when you use someone else's code (which are what modules are), it's always best to check regularly for published vulnerabilities. This article shows you how to use the pip-audit tool to find CVE advisories issued for Python modules you're using in your project.

Most Python coders list all third-party dependencies in a requirements.txt file, which is useful for PyPi and other dependency management systems:

module1==x.y.z
module2==x.y.z
module1==x.y.z

This makes your development environment reproducible, but it also leaves you exposed to using older versions that may be vulnerable to exploits.

Think about your versions as a garden: They need watering, trimming, and attention. A good project keeps versions up to date when a vulnerability is found, and tools like pip-audit make this job easier.

Here's how to use pip-audit to scan your Python project and learn whether any of your third-party libraries have known vulnerabilities with CVE identifiers.
Install pip-audit

Install the latest version of pip-audit with pip:

python3 -m venv ~/virtualenv/pip-audit
$ . ~/virtualenv/pip-audit/bin/activate

$ pip install --upgrade pip pip-audit

The pip-audit command expects a requirements.txt file. If your project doesn't have one (for example, if it uses a single setup.py), generate one with:

. ~/virtualenv/myprojectvirtualenv/bin/activate
# Install your project as usual, like python setup.py develop
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

Analyze a project

Now you should be ready to start analyzing your projects for potential vulnerabilities in your modules.
Example 1: A project with no vulnerabilities

Vision2 is a nice script that correlates the output of an Nmap scan XML file with the CVE NIST vulnerability database. Here is an example:

$ git clone https://github.com/CoolerVoid/Vision2.git
Cloning into 'Vision2'...

$ pip-audit  --requirement Vision2/re
requirements.txt  result_nmap.xml   

$ pip-audit  --requirement Vision2/requirements.txt 
\ Installing package in isolated environment                                  Processing /tmp/tmpyqd6k_6g/termcolor-1.1.0.tar.gz

Successfully built termcolor
Installing collected packages: termcolor
Successfully installed termcolor-1.1.0
No known vulnerabilities found   

Good, the project is not using any vulnerable libraries.
Example 2: An RSS reader with a vulnerability

EnableSysadminRSSReader contains a package where a recent vulnerability has been found (the project is secure, but I will downgrade one of the libraries on purpose for this example). Analyze it:

Install it (see my README for instructions):

$ git clone git@github.com:josevnz/EnableSysadminRssReader.git
$ cd EnableSysadminRssReader
$ sed -i 's#4.7.1#4.6.0#' requirements.txt

I downgraded the version of lxml from 4.7.1 to 4.6.0 (note the sed -i command). What happens when you scan it?

$ pip-audit  --requirement requirements.txt 
Found 3 known vulnerabilities in 1 packages        
Name Version ID             Fix Versions
---- ------- -------------- ------------
lxml 4.6.0   PYSEC-2021-19  4.6.3
lxml 4.6.0   PYSEC-2020-62  4.6.2
lxml 4.6.0   PYSEC-2021-852 4.6.5

There are warnings for lxml 4.6.0.

lxml is a good library to parse XML files easily. Software is complex, and this library had a bug that could be exploited. If you go to the NIST database and search for lxml, you will see more details on the advisory CVE-2021-43818. Take a look at the requirements.txt file:

requests==2.27.1
rich==11.0.0
lxml==4.6.0

The easiest fix is to upgrade to the recommended version of lxml (4.6.5), as it is a minor upgrade that contains the bug fix and makes minimal API changes. After checking the latest version at the time of this writing (4.7.1), I decided to go with a higher version, as my code doesn't need further modifications:

requests==2.27.1
rich==11.0.0
# lxml==4.6.0 <- Vulnerable to CVE-2021-43818
lxml==4.7.1

If you scan the project again, you get:

$ pip-audit  --requirement /home/josevnz/EnableSysadmin/EnableSysadminRssReader/requirements.txt 
No known vulnerabilities found

After fixing this, I can say my favorite quote from Poltergeist, "This house is clean."
Can an IDE tell you if a library is stale?

Yes, it can. For example, PyCharm and VS Code tell you if there is a newer version of a third-party library. For this example, I used an outdated version of Rich:

You should not ignore these warnings.
Check your Python code

I'll summarize a few things you learned:

    You can scan your Python projects for third-party library vulnerabilities using pip-audit.
    As a plus, you can see how you can quickly wrap your Python code using the new setuptools packaging rules (setup.cfg as opposed to setup.py).

One more thing: Third-party vulnerabilities are not an issue exclusive to Python; other languages suffer from the same issue. In a follow-up article, I will show you how to check your Java code.

The security risks of pip and PyPI

June 2020 2 minute read

Installing packages with pip via PyPI is very convenient but dangerous. Here I explain the risks of running pip install <package>.

Python has two standard ways for packaging: source distribution (sdist) and binary distribution (wheel).

Wheels are a pre-built distribution format that provides faster installation compared to Source Distributions (sdist), especially when a project contains compiled extensions (wheel vs sdist).

The issues:

    sdist packages can run arbitrary code on installation (setup.py is run). Read this PEP to learn more sdist problems and why wheel is better.
    PyPI, the repository which pip downloads from, is not curated. Anyone can upload a package without filter.
    pip doesn’t verify cryptographic signatures, which means there’s no way to verify the authenticity of the package. PyPI developers aren’t concerned. What’s more, wheel could verify signed wheels but this option was removed.
    All it takes is to misspell a package name to RUN malware. You are not just installing malware, you are running it from the moment you run pip install, thanks to sdist packages’ ability to run arbitrary code. This kind of attack is called typosquatting, and has happened many times in PyPI (1, 2).

Notice that:

    pip can install from either Source Distributions (sdist) or Wheels, but if both are present on PyPI, pip will prefer a compatible wheel. (source)

So if a malicious package only exists in sdist format, arbitrary code will run for sure. The good thing is that with pip install <package> --only-binary, pip won’t install source packages. The bad thing is that there are many popular packages that don’t provide a wheel, so you can’t always rely on it.

The only relevant security feature pip provides is integrity checks via hashes

In conclusion, pip is insecure by design and I have the impression that developers are not very concerned about it. Considering Python is an extremely popular language used by many newbies into programming, it would be appropriate to better protect ignorant or reckless users.

So what can responsible users do about it? I have some ideas:

    Never run pip with root
    Minimize the number of external dependencies as much as possible. The less third-party code you install and run, the less likely it is you will run malware or introduce vulnerabilities in you software.
    Use a tool to manage virtual environments such as pip-tools. With it, instead of using pip directly, first you write your dependencies in a file and then you synchronize this list with you virtual environment, thereby reducing the risk of mistyping a package name or having more packages than required.
    Have a different Linux user to develop. As developers, we need to install a lot of packages from strangers. To avoid compromising our personal files, I recommend you create a Linux user exclusively for developing. Make sure the directories under /home don’t have permissions for ‘others’, as Debian-based distros are too permissive by default.
