Modernized Example Tool

This script demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and process it without
deeply nested loops. It uses list comprehensions and helper functions to keep
the code clean and maintainable.

In this example, we:
  - Fetch coin ticker data from a CoinMarketCap-like API.
  - Extract the coin IDs from the data.
  - Pair each coin ID with its rank (its position in the list).
  - Print the results in a sorted order.

This structure can be adapted to other tasks where you might otherwise use nested loops.

Explanation
Modular Functions:
Each task (fetching data, extracting IDs, pairing with ranks, printing) is handled in its own function. 
This not only makes the code easier to read and maintain but also allows for unit testing of individual parts.

List Comprehension & zip:
Instead of using nested loops, we extract coin IDs with a single list comprehension and then pair them with their rank using Pythonâ€™s built-in zip function.

Error Handling:
The fetch_ticker_data function uses raise_for_status() to immediately raise an exception if the API call fails, and the exception is caught in main().

Type Annotations:
Function signatures include type hints to clarify the expected input and output types.                                                        
```
