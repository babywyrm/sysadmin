# ..Modlishka..

Modlishka is a powerful and flexible HTTP reverse proxy. It implements an entirely new and interesting approach of handling browser-based HTTP traffic flow, which allows to transparently proxy multi-domain destination traffic, both TLS and non-TLS, over a single domain, without a requirement of installing any additional certificate on the client. What does this exactly mean? In short, it simply has a lot of potential, that can be used in many use case scenarios...

From the security perspective, Modlishka can be currently used to:
-	 Support ethical phishing penetration tests with a transparent and automated reverse proxy component that has a universal 2FA ‚Äúbypass‚Äù support.
-  Automatically poison HTTP 301 browsers cache and permanently hijack non-TLS URLS.
-  Diagnose and hijack browser-based applications HTTP traffic from the "Client Domain Hooking" attack perspective.
-  Wrap legacy websites with TLS layer, confuse crawler bots and automated scanners, etc.


Modlishka was written as an attempt overcome standard reverse proxy limitations and as a personal challenge to see what is possible with sufficient motivation and a bit of extra research time. 
The achieved results appeared to be very interesting and the tool was initially released and later updated with aim to:
- Highlight currently used two factor authentication ([2FA](https://blog.duszynski.eu/phishing-ng-bypassing-2fa-with-modlishka/)) scheme weaknesses, so adequate security solutions can be created and implemented by the industry.
- Support other projects that could benefit from a universal and transparent reverse proxy.
- Raise community awareness about modern phishing techniques and strategies and support penetration testers in their daily work.


Modlishka was primarily written for security related tasks. Nevertheless, it can be helpful in other, non-security related, usage scenarios.

Efficient proxying !

Features
--------

Some of the most important 'Modlishka' features :

**General:**
-   Point-and-click HTTP and HTTPS reverse proxying of an arbitrary domain/s.
-   Full control of "cross" origin TLS traffic flow from your users browsers (without a requirement of installing any additional certificate on the client).
-   Easy and fast configuration through command line options and JSON configuration files.
-   Pattern based JavaScript payload injection.
-   Wrapping websites with an extra "security": TLS wrapping, authentication, relevant security headers, etc. 
-   Striping websites from all encryption and security headers (back to 90's MITM style). 
-   Stateless design. Can be scaled up easily to handle an arbitrary amount of traffic  - e.g. through a DNS load balancer.
-   Can be extended easily with your ideas through modular plugins.
-   Automatic test TLS certificate generation plugin for the proxy domain (requires a self-signed CA certificate)
-   Written in Go, so it works basically on all platforms and architectures: Windows, OSX, Linux, BSD supported...

**Security related:**
-  Support for majority of 2FA authentication schemes (out of the box).
-   Practical implementation of the "[Client Domain Hooking](https://blog.duszynski.eu/client-domain-hooking-in-practice/)" attack. Supported with a diagnostic plugin.
-  User credential harvesting (with context based on URL parameter passed identifiers).
-  Web panel plugin with a summary of automatically collected credentials and one-click user session impersonation module (proof-of-concept/beta).
-  No website templates (just point Modlishka to the target domain - in most cases, it will be handled automatically without any additional manual configuration).

# Evilginx 3.0

**Evilginx** is a man-in-the-middle attack framework used for phishing login credentials along with session cookies, which in turn allows to bypass 2-factor authentication protection.

This tool is a successor to [Evilginx](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx), released in 2017, which used a custom version of nginx HTTP server to provide man-in-the-middle functionality to act as a proxy between a browser and phished website.
Present version is fully written in GO as a standalone application, which implements its own HTTP and DNS server, making it extremely easy to set up and use.

## Disclaimer

I am very much aware that Evilginx can be used for nefarious purposes. This work is merely a demonstration of what adept attackers can do. It is the defender's responsibility to take such attacks into consideration and find ways to protect their users against this type of phishing attacks. Evilginx should be used only in legitimate penetration testing assignments with written permission from to-be-phished parties.
